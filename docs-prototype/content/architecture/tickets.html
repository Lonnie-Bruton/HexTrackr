    <p class="text-muted mb-4">HexTrackr is a cybersecurity management system with a dual-purpose architecture: a ticket management system and a vulnerability management system.  The system uses a Node.js/Express backend with an SQLite database for persistence. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS (Tabler.io framework), and JavaScript.  The system includes features such as CSV import/export, data backup/restore, pagination, search and filtering, and a user-friendly interface.  A system for managing shared documentation files is implemented, stored in base64 format within the localStorage.  Security considerations are implemented throughout the codebase, including input sanitization and parameterized queries.  The project utilizes several JavaScript libraries, including `jsPDF`, `JSZip`, `XLSX`, and `PapaParse`.  The `scripts` directory is structured for modularity, separating shared components from page-specific logic.</p>
