    <h2><i class="fas fa-road me-2"></i>HexTrackr Codebase Analysis</h2>
    <p class="text-muted mb-4">HexTrackr is a cybersecurity management system with a dual-purpose architecture: a ticket management system and a vulnerability management system.  It utilizes a Node.js/Express backend with an SQLite database for persistent data storage. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging Bootstrap and Tabler.io for UI components.  The system features CSV import/export functionality for both tickets and vulnerabilities, as well as a robust API for data interaction.  A built-in version manager ensures consistency across application components.  Importantly, the system includes robust error handling and security measures to protect against common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).  The project includes a prototype for documentation generation, demonstrating an automated approach to maintain up-to-date documentation.</p>
