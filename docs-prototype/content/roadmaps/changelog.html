    <h2><i class="fas fa-road me-2"></i>HexTrackr Codebase Analysis</h2>
    <p class="text-muted mb-4">HexTrackr is a cybersecurity management system built with Node.js, Express.js, SQLite, and HTML/JavaScript.  It features a ticket management system and a vulnerability management system, both interacting with a shared SQLite database. The frontend uses a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging Bootstrap and Tabler.io for styling and UI components.  The backend API is exposed via various Express.js routes, handling CRUD operations for tickets and vulnerabilities. A robust backup and restore mechanism is implemented using ZIP archives and JSON serialization.  The system includes  CSV import/export capabilities for both tickets and vulnerabilities, utilizing PapaParse for CSV parsing.</p>
