    <h2><i class="fas fa-road me-2"></i>HexTrackr Codebase Analysis</h2>
    <p class="text-muted mb-4">HexTrackr is a cybersecurity management system built with a Node.js/Express backend and a client-side interface using HTML, JavaScript, and potentially Bootstrap/Tabler.io.  It features a ticket management system and a vulnerability management system, both interacting with a SQLite database. The system incorporates CSV import/export functionality and uses a modular architecture with shared components.  Security considerations are integrated throughout the codebase, including input sanitization and parameterized queries.  The system also includes a rudimentary versioning system.</p>
