    <h2><i class="fas fa-road me-2"></i>HexTrackr Codebase Analysis</h2>
    <p class="text-muted mb-4">HexTrackr is a cybersecurity management system with a dual-purpose architecture: a ticket management system and a vulnerability management system.  The frontend is built using HTML, JavaScript, and likely utilizes a framework (Bootstrap and/or Tabler.io are referenced in the code). The backend is implemented using Node.js with Express.js for routing and SQLite for the database.  The system features CSV import/export capabilities, data backup and restore functionality, and a user interface for managing tickets and vulnerabilities.  Security considerations are integrated throughout the codebase, including input sanitization and parameterized queries.  A rudimentary version management system is present (`scripts/version-manager.js`).  The project architecture is modular, with shared components separated from page-specific logic.  The documentation system itself appears to use Tabler.io templates with Markdown sources.</p>
