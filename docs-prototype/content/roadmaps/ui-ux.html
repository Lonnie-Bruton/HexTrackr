    <h2><i class="fas fa-road me-2"></i>HexTrackr Codebase Analysis</h2>
    <p class="text-muted mb-4">HexTrackr is a cybersecurity management system with a Node.js/Express backend and a client-side interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  It features a ticket management system and a vulnerability management system, both interacting with a SQLite database. The frontend utilizes various JavaScript libraries including Bootstrap, PapaParse, JSZip, and potentially others for data handling, UI, and visualization.  The `scripts/` directory contains modular JavaScript code, separating shared components from page-specific logic.  The `server.js` file manages the backend API, database interactions, and static file serving. `scripts/init-database.js` sets up the SQLite database schema.  A version management script (`scripts/version-manager.js`) updates version numbers across the application.  A prototype documentation system is present in `docs-prototype/`.  The system includes robust error handling and security measures such as input sanitization and parameterized queries.  The application handles CSV imports for both tickets and vulnerabilities, providing both replace and append options when importing data. It also includes backup and restore capabilities for individual data types (tickets, vulnerabilities) as well as complete system backups, and a robust and highly configurable ServiceNow integration.</p>
