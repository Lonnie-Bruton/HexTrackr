    <h2><i class="fas fa-road me-2"></i>HexTrackr Codebase Analysis</h2>
    <p class="text-muted mb-4">HexTrackr is a cybersecurity management system with a dual focus: ticket management and vulnerability management.  The system uses a Node.js/Express backend with an SQLite database and a frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  The frontend utilizes several JavaScript libraries including Bootstrap 5, PapaParse, JSZip, and potentially others for specific features (AG Grid, ApexCharts are mentioned but not directly included in the provided code). The `scripts` directory houses modular JavaScript components, separating shared functionality from page-specific logic.  A `docs-prototype` directory suggests an ongoing effort to improve documentation using Tabler.io templates and a system for automated generation.  The server utilizes various middleware to improve performance and security.  The application includes robust CSV import/export capabilities for vulnerabilities and tickets, and a RESTful API.</p>
