  "prompt": "Analyze this development workflow: A team is building a memory system that captures VS Code chat sessions, processes them with AI models (Ollama for real-time, Claude for deep analysis), and stores insights in a Neo4j knowledge graph. What are the key architectural considerations and potential failure points?",
  "response": "## Key Architectural Considerations\n\n### 1. **Data Pipeline Architecture**\n- **Event Streaming vs Batch Processing**: VS Code chat sessions need real-time capture but analysis can be asynchronous\n- **Message Queue Integration**: Consider Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ between VS Code and processing layers to decouple components\n- **Dual Processing Tracks**: Parallel pipelines for Ollama (low-latency) and Claude (high-quality) with result reconciliation\n\n### 2. **Model Orchestration Strategy**\n```\nVS Code → Queue → Router → [Ollama (fast path)]\n                        ↘ [Claude (deep path)]\n                           ↓\n                    Insight Merger → Neo4j\n```\n\n- **Hybrid Processing**: Use Ollama for immediate feedback, Claude for background enrichment\n- **Cost Optimization**: Route only complex queries to Claude based on complexity scoring\n- **Fallback Hierarchy**: Ollama → Claude → Cached responses\n\n### 3. **Knowledge Graph Design**\n- **Schema Evolution**: Plan for iterative schema changes as insight patterns emerge\n- **Relationship Modeling**: Focus on temporal, semantic, and dependency relationships\n- **Index Strategy**: Optimize for common query patterns (by session, topic, time range)\n\n## Critical Failure Points & Mitigations\n\n### 1. **Data Capture Layer**\n**Failure Points:**\n- VS Code extension crashes or memory leaks\n- Lost messages during high-volume sessions\n- Privacy/security breaches with sensitive code\n\n**Mitigations:**\n- Implement circuit breakers and rate limiting\n- Local buffering with persistent queue\n- Content filtering and PII detection before transmission\n\n### 2. **AI Processing Bottlenecks**\n**Failure Points:**\n- Ollama server unavailability or resource exhaustion\n- Claude API rate limits or quota exceeded\n- Model hallucinations creating invalid graph data\n\n**Mitigations:**\n```yaml\nProcessing Strategy:\n  - Load balancing across multiple Ollama instances\n  - Exponential backoff for Claude API calls\n  - Validation layer before graph insertion\n  - Confidence scoring for AI-generated insights\n```\n\n### 3. **Neo4j Performance Issues**\n**Failure Points:**\n- Write bottlenecks during bulk insight creation\n- Query performance degradation as graph grows\n- Transaction deadlocks with concurrent updates\n\n**Mitigations:**\n- Batch writes with UNWIND operations\n- Implement graph partitioning by time/project\n- Read replicas for query workloads\n- Regular graph maintenance and pruning\n\n### 4. **Data Consistency Challenges**\n**Failure",
