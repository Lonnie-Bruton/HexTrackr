  "prompt": "How would you optimize a slow database query?",
  "response": "Optimizing a slow database query involves several steps and strategies to enhance performance. Here are some effective methods:\n\n1. **Identify the Problem**: Start by identifying which queries are causing slowness. Use tools like EXPLAIN or similar profiling tools provided by your database management system (DBMS) to analyze the execution plans of your queries.\n\n2. **Indexing**: Add indexes on columns that are frequently used in WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY clauses. Indexes can significantly speed up data retrieval. However, be cautious as they also slow down write operations like INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.\n\n3. **Query Optimization**:\n   - Simplify the query where possible.\n   - Avoid using SELECT *. Instead, specify only the columns you need.\n   - Use JOINs judiciously; avoid Cartesian joins by ensuring that join conditions are properly specified.\n   - Rewrite complex queries into simpler ones if possible.\n\n4. **Database Normalization**: Ensure your database schema is normalized to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. However, be aware of the trade-off between normalization and performance.\n\n5. **Partitioning**: If your tables are very large, consider partitioning them based on a column that frequently appears in WHERE clauses. This can help the DBMS process only relevant parts of the table for queries.\n\n6. **Caching**: Implement caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed data in memory. Tools like Redis or Memcached can be used to cache query results.\n\n7. **Optimize Hardware**:",
