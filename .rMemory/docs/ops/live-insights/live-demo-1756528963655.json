  "prompt": "What are some common security vulnerabilities in web apps?",
  "response": "Web applications can be vulnerable to various types of attacks. Some common security vulnerabilities include:\n\n1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): This occurs when an attacker is able to inject malicious scripts into a webpage that other users will execute. XSS can lead to data theft, session hijacking, and defacement.\n\n2. SQL Injection: Attackers exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious SQL code into input fields of web applications. It allows attackers to steal or manipulate the database.\n\n3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): This type of attack occurs when a user is tricked into performing an action on a website without their knowledge or consent, typically by clicking on a link that includes a malicious script.\n\n4. Insecure Direct Object References: When a web application provides direct access to objects such as files, database records, etc., without proper validation and authorization checks, it can lead to unauthorized access.\n\n5. Broken Authentication: This vulnerability is related to the security of user authentication processes. It allows attackers to bypass authentication mechanisms, steal session tokens, or perform other attacks.\n\n6. Security Misconfiguration: This occurs when a web application is not properly configured, leaving it vulnerable to known security risks such as weak passwords, outdated software, and misconfigured firewalls.\n\n7. Insufficient Logging & Monitoring: If a web application does not provide adequate logging and monitoring of user activities, it can be difficult for administrators to detect and respond to security incidents in a timely manner.\n\n8.
