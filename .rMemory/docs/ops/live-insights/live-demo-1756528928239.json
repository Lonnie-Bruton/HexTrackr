  "prompt": "What's the difference between REST and GraphQL APIs?",
  "response": "REST (Representational State Transfer) and GraphQL are both popular approaches for building APIs, but they have some key differences:\n\n1. Data Structure: REST APIs use a fixed set of endpoints to retrieve or manipulate data, while GraphQL allows clients to specify exactly what data they need.\n\n2. Performance: GraphQL is generally faster than REST because it reduces the number of requests and data transfer required by allowing clients to fetch all the necessary data in a single request. With REST, clients may have to make multiple requests to get the same amount of data.\n\n3. Flexibility: REST APIs are more rigid and inflexible compared to GraphQL. With GraphQL, clients can query for exactly what they need, making it easier to maintain and update.\n\n4. Learning Curve: REST is a widely adopted protocol with many tutorials and resources available online, making it an easy choice for developers who are already familiar with web development. GraphQL has a steeper learning curve because it requires developers to understand how to define types and queries in their API schema.\n\n5. Documentation: REST APIs often have automatically generated documentation that describes the available endpoints and data structures, while GraphQL allows developers to create custom documentation that is tailored to their specific needs.\n\nOverall, both REST and GraphQL can be effective for building APIs, but they are suited to different use cases depending on the requirements of your application.",
