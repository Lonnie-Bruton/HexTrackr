  "prompt": "Explain the benefits of using TypeScript over JavaScript",
  "response": "TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript and adds an optional static type system to it. It was developed by Microsoft in 2012 to address some of the shortcomings of JavaScript, such as its lack of static typing. Here are some benefits of using TypeScript over JavaScript:\n\n  1. Better code quality: With static typing, TypeScript helps you catch errors at compile time rather than runtime, which can save a lot of debugging time and effort.\n  2. Improved development experience: TypeScript provides features like code completion, syntax highlighting, and type checking that make the development process easier and more efficient.\n  3. Better team collaboration: With static typing, it's easier for different developers to understand each other's code, as they can see what types of values are expected at each point.\n  4. Easier refactoring: TypeScript makes it easier to refactor your code because the type system helps you identify where and how changes need to be made.\n  5. Increased safety: With static typing, TypeScript helps prevent common mistakes like passing in the wrong type of value or forgetting to handle an exception.\n  6. Better tooling support: Many modern development tools, such as editors and IDEs, have built-in support for TypeScript, making it easier to work with.\n\nOverall, TypeScript provides a more robust and efficient way to write JavaScript code, which can lead to fewer bugs and a better overall development experience.",
