## Key Insights

### Problem Solution: Neo4j Connection Routing Error

Type: problem_solution
Source: 20250830T031443

- Problem: MCP -32603 error - Could not perform discovery. No routing servers available
- Cause: Neo4j Enterprise routing table empty after VS Code restart - RoutingTable shows routers=[], readers=[], writers=[]
- Solution: Environment variables not being picked up correctly after restart, requires reconfiguration of connection settings

### Technical Decision: Memento MCP Integration with Neo4j

Type: technical_decision
Source: 20250830T031443

- Decision: Use Memento MCP for persistent knowledge storage with Neo4j Enterprise backend
- Rationale: Provides graph-based relationship mapping for development context and decisions
- Implementation: MCP tools including mcp_memento_create_entities and mcp_memento_search_nodes

### Problem Solution: Invalid Terminal ID Error

Type: problem_solution
Source: 20250830T031443

- Problem: Error from tool get_terminal_output - Invalid terminal ID: 34304
- Cause: Terminal session expired or ID reference became stale
- Solution: Need to refresh terminal references or use active terminal IDs

### Code Discovery: Memento Search Query Syntax

Type: code_knowledge
Source: 20250830T031443

- Type: API Pattern
- Purpose: Search nodes in Memento/Neo4j database
- Usage: mcp_memento_search_nodes requires proper regex syntax, wildcard '*' alone causes 'Dangling meta character' error

### Process Knowledge: VS Code Copilot Chat Session Management

Type: process_knowledge
Source: 20250830T031443

- Process: Copilot Chat conversation history summarization
- Steps: Automatic summarization triggers after conversation milestones, uses claude-sonnet-4 model
- Tools: ConversationHistorySummarizer with full summarization mode

### Technical Decision: AI Model Selection for Development

Type: technical_decision
Source: 20250830T031443

- Decision: Using claude-sonnet-4 as primary AI model for development assistance
- Rationale: Consistent successful responses across various panel/editAgent operations
- Implementation: All requests show successful completion with claude-sonnet-4 deployment

### Problem Solution: API Key Authentication Errors

Type: problem_solution
Source: 20250830T031443

- Problem: Multiple API authentication failures - Gemini (API Key not found) and Anthropic (401 invalid x-api-key)
- Cause: Missing or incorrectly configured API keys for third-party AI services
- Solution: Focus on GitHub Copilot's built-in models which authenticate successfully

### Problem Solution: Neo4j Connection Failure After Restart

Type: problem_solution
Source: 20250830T031248

- Problem: Neo4j routing servers unavailable after system restart - 'Could not perform discovery. No routing servers available'
- Cause: Neo4j Enterprise service not automatically starting or connection pool not reinitializing after restart
- Solution: Manual restart of Neo4j service required after system restart

### Technical Decision: OpenAI Embeddings with Neo4j Enterprise

Type: technical_decision
Source: 20250830T031248

- Decision: Use OpenAI embeddings with Neo4j Enterprise for semantic relationships
- Rationale: Testing one-to-one semantic relationship capabilities with Claude integration
- Implementation: Memento MCP creates entities with embeddings stored in Neo4j

### Problem Solution: MCP Tool Disabled Error

Type: problem_solution
Source: 20250830T031248

- Problem: Tool 'mcp_memento_debug_embedding_config' is disabled and cannot be called
- Cause: User configuration has disabled specific MCP debugging tools
- Solution: Enable the tool in user settings or use alternative debugging methods
