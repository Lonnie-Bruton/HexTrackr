## Key Insights

### Problem Solution: Neo4j Connection Routing Error

Type: problem_solution
Source: 20250830T031443

- Problem: MCP -32603 error - Could not perform discovery. No routing servers available
- Cause: Neo4j Enterprise routing table empty after VS Code restart - RoutingTable shows no routers, readers, or writers
- Solution: Environment variables not being picked up correctly after restart, need to verify Neo4j connection configuration

### Technical Decision: MCP Memento Integration with Neo4j

Type: technical_decision
Source: 20250830T031443

- Decision: Using Memento MCP for persistent knowledge storage with Neo4j Enterprise backend
- Rationale: Provides graph-based relationship mapping for development knowledge
- Implementation: MCP tools including mcp_memento_create_entities, mcp_memento_search_nodes

### Problem Solution: Invalid Terminal ID Error

Type: problem_solution
Source: 20250830T031443

- Problem: Error from tool get_terminal_output - Invalid terminal ID: 34304
- Cause: Terminal session expired or ID mismatch after VS Code operations
- Solution: Need to refresh terminal references or use current active terminal

### Code Discovery: Memento Search Query Regex Pattern

Type: code_knowledge
Source: 20250830T031443

- Type: API Pattern Error
- Purpose: Search nodes in Memento MCP database
- Usage: mcp_memento_search_nodes requires valid regex patterns, not wildcards

### Process Knowledge: VS Code Extension API Activation

Type: process_knowledge
Source: 20250830T031443

- Process: GitHub Pull Request extension activation timing
- Steps: Extension not activated immediately on VS Code startup, requires lazy loading
- Tools: GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github extension

Type: technical_decision
Source: 20250830T031443

- Decision: Using claude-sonnet-4 model for all Copilot chat interactions
- Rationale: Consistent model provides reliable responses for code generation and editing
- Implementation: All requests show successful completion with claude-sonnet-4

### Problem Solution: API Key Authentication Errors

Type: problem_solution
Source: 20250830T031443

- Problem: Authentication errors for Gemini and Anthropic models - invalid API keys
- Cause: Missing or incorrect API key configuration for third-party AI services
