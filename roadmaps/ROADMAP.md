- **API Rate Limiting**: No protection against abuse or brute force attacks

---

## ÔøΩ **DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW & STANDARDS**

### Git Management Standards

- **Branch Protection**: Never commit directly to `main` branch
- **Feature Branches**: Use `feature/description` or `fix/issue-name` pattern
- **Git Checkpoints**: Make commits every 2-3 file changes with descriptive messages
- **Context Preservation**: Include sufficient context in commit messages

### Code Quality Standards

#### Codacy Compliance (MANDATORY)

- **After ANY File Edit**: Run `codacy_cli_analyze` for each edited file immediately
- **After ANY Dependency Changes**: Run `codacy_cli_analyze` with tool "trivy"
- **Fix All Issues**: Resolve issues immediately before proceeding
- **Quality Gate**: Maintain <50 total issues, zero critical/high security issues

#### Documentation Maintenance (MANDATORY)

Update these files with EVERY change:

- `systeminfo.json` - Project state and dependencies
- `roadmaps/roadmap.md` - Feature progress (this file)
- `docs-source/project-management/codacy-compliance.md` - Quality metrics
- `docs-source/api/endpoints.md` - When adding/modifying APIs
- `docs-source/security/README.md` - When implementing security features

#### Markdown Standards (ENFORCED)

- Run markdown formatter before and after editing: `node scripts/fix-markdown.js --file=path/to/file.md`
- Follow markdownlint rules: MD022, MD032, MD036, MD029, MD024, MD013

### Sprint Management

#### Sprint File Template

Every sprint file (`roadmaps/sprint-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.md`) must include:

- Final merge: [when ready]

## Codacy Impact

- Expected new issues: [estimate]
- Files to analyze: [list]
- Critical fixes needed: [priority items]

```

#### Context Management

**When to Start New Chat**:

- After every 3-5 completed tasks
- When context becomes too long
- Before tackling complex features
- After major git checkpoints

**Context Handoff Protocol**:

1. Update current sprint file with progress
2. Commit all changes to git
3. Summarize next steps clearly
4. Save current state to memory
5. Provide user with resume instructions
