---

## ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

### **Database Architecture**
- **Issue**: CSV imports creating duplicate records instead of updating existing ones
- **Impact**: No trend tracking capability, inflated data, storage bloat
- **Priority**: CRITICAL - blocks all trend visualization features

### **Layout & Responsiveness**
- **Issue**: Vulnerabilities page body stretches full browser width with excessive dead space
- **Impact**: Poor user experience, non-responsive design, inefficient space utilization
- **Priority**: HIGH - affects daily usability and professional appearance

### **AG Grid Table Issues**
- **Issue**: Table cells don't auto-adjust on browser resize, pagination size selector only enables scroll wheel
- **Impact**: Poor responsive behavior, pagination doesn't actually resize table
- **Priority**: HIGH - core table functionality broken

### **CVE Link Functionality**
- **Issue**: CVE links opening ALL CVEs instead of just the clicked one
- **Impact**: Poor user experience, broken functionality
- **Priority**: HIGH - affects daily usage

### **Modal System**
- **Issue**: Nested modals appear behind parent modals (z-index problems)
- **Impact**: Device modals inaccessible from vulnerability modals
- **Priority**: HIGH - broken navigation flow

## ðŸ“‹ **HANDOFF NOTES**

### **For Next Developer/Session**
1. **Start Here**: Phase 1.1 - Analyze Current Data Structure in UI_UX_ROADMAP.md
2. **Key Files**: 
   - `/data/hextrackr.db` - Current database to analyze
   - `server.js` - API endpoints to understand data flow
   - `vulnerabilities.html` - Frontend that needs time-series data
3. **Critical Path**: Database migration must complete before any UI enhancements
4. **Testing**: Use sample data in `/sample data/` folder for migration validation

### **Known Dependencies**
- Database analysis â†’ Schema design â†’ Migration scripts â†’ API updates â†’ Frontend changes
- No UI work should proceed until time-series foundation is solid
- All CVE link fixes depend on understanding current data structure

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **SUCCESS DEFINITION**

- [ ] Current data structure fully documented and understood
- [ ] Time-series schema designed and validated
- [ ] Migration path clearly defined with rollback procedures
- [ ] Sample data successfully migrated to new structure
- [ ] API endpoints updated to support latest-value queries
