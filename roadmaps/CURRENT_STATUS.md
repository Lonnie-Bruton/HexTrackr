## ðŸ“‹ **HANDOFF NOTES**

### **For Next Developer/Session**
1. **Start Here**: Phase 1.1 - Analyze Current Data Structure in UI_UX_ROADMAP.md
2. **Key Files**: 
   - `/data/hextrackr.db` - Current database to analyze
   - `server.js` - API endpoints to understand data flow
   - `vulnerabilities.html` - Frontend that needs time-series data
3. **Critical Path**: Database migration must complete before any UI enhancements
4. **Testing**: Use sample data in `/sample data/` folder for migration validation

### **Known Dependencies**
- Database analysis â†’ Schema design â†’ Migration scripts â†’ API updates â†’ Frontend changes
- No UI work should proceed until time-series foundation is solid
- All CVE link fixes depend on understanding current data structure
