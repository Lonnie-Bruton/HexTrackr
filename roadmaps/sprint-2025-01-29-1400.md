# Sprint: Documentation Structure Consolidation - 2025-01-29-1400

## Context for Resume

- **Current Branch**: copilot
- **Last Completed**: Consolidated 4 roadmap files into unified roadmaps/roadmap.md
- **Next Steps**: Await user selection of specific Codacy issue from dashboard
- **Files Modified**: roadmaps/roadmap.md (major consolidation), roadmaps/archive/ (old files)
- **Codacy Status**: 4 security issues available for user selection

## Consolidation Achievement ✅

- **COMPLETED**: Unified all roadmap content from 4 separate files into single roadmaps/roadmap.md
- **STRUCTURE**: Current Sprint → Completed Features → In Progress → Planned Features → Standards
- **WORKFLOW**: Aligned with issue-driven Codacy compliance workflow as user requested
- **ARCHIVE**: Moved old files to roadmaps/archive/ for reference
- **HIERARCHY**: Established clean hierarchy: copilot-instructions → roadmaps/roadmap.md → sprint_xx.md

## Documentation Updates Completed ✅

- [x] roadmaps/roadmap.md: Complete consolidation from 4 source files
- [x] roadmaps/archive/: Created archive with old files for reference
- [x] Sprint workflow: Updated to reflect issue-driven approach
- [x] Path corrections: Fixed copilot-instructions.md to point to /roadmaps/

## Next Actions for User

1. **Review Codacy Dashboard**: Examine the 4 critical security issues
2. **Select Priority Issue**: Choose specific issue for targeted implementation
3. **Provide Issue Details**: Share Codacy issue description and file location
4. **Begin Fix Implementation**: AI will implement targeted fix with immediate verification

## Available Security Issues for Selection

1. **Generic Object Injection Sink** - High severity in docs-prototype/generate-docs.js
2. **fs.writeFileSync non-literal arguments** - File system security risk
3. **fs.existsSync non-literal arguments** - File system security risk  
4. **Unsafe innerHTML assignments** - DOM security vulnerability across multiple files

## Quality Gate Status

- **Total Issues**: 83 (down from 370+ after ESLint improvements)
- **Security Critical**: 4 release-blocking vulnerabilities
- **Target**: <50 total issues, zero critical/high security issues for v1.0.3
- **Process**: Issue-driven → Targeted fix → Immediate compliance verification

## Git Strategy

- **Branch**: copilot (current working branch)
- **Checkpoints**: After each security fix
- **Documentation**: Update roadmaps/roadmap.md with progress
- **Compliance**: Run codacy_cli_analyze after every change

## Codacy Workflow Implementation

- **Method**: User-driven dashboard selection pattern
- **Process**: User selects issue → AI locates instances → AI fixes systematically → AI verifies with Codacy CLI
- **Quality Gate**: Zero critical/high security issues before v1.0.3 release
- **Success Criteria**: All 4 security vulnerabilities resolved with Codacy verification
