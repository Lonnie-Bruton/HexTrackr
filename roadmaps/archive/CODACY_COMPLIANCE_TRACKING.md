# Codacy Compliance Tracking

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 MD009 -->

Last updated: August 27, 2025

## 🎯 **Compliance Initiative Overview**

**Goal**: Establish Codacy compliance as a quality gate before each patch version release
**Current Version**: 1.0.2
**Next Release**: 1.0.3 (blocked on security fixes)
**Quality Standard**: Zero critical/high security issues, <50 total issues

---

## 📊 **Current Status - August 27, 2025**

### **Codacy Scan Results**

- **Total Issues**: 83 (down from 370+ after ESLint config improvements)
- **Security Issues**: 4 critical vulnerabilities (release blocking)
- **Status**: 🔴 Not compliant (security issues present)

### **Issue Breakdown by Priority**

#### 🚨 **Critical Security Issues** (Release Blocking)

1. **Generic Object Injection Sink**
   - Location: `docs-prototype/generate-docs.js`
   - Risk: High - Object injection vulnerabilities
   - Action Required: Sanitize object inputs, validate property access

1. **fs.writeFileSync with non-literal argument**
   - Location: `docs-prototype/generate-docs.js`
   - Risk: High - File system security
   - Action Required: Use literal paths or proper validation

1. **fs.existsSync with non-literal argument**
   - Location: `docs-prototype/generate-docs.js`
   - Risk: High - File system security
   - Action Required: Use literal paths or proper validation

1. **Unsafe assignment to innerHTML**
   - Location: Various DOM manipulation files
   - Risk: Medium-High - XSS vulnerability
   - Action Required: Replace with textContent or sanitized HTML

#### 📋 **Code Quality Issues** (79 remaining)

- ESLint violations (reduced significantly)
- Code style and consistency issues
- Complexity warnings
- Best practice recommendations

## 🛡️ **Security Fix Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 1: File System Security** (Priority 1)

- [ ] Audit all fs.writeFileSync calls for dynamic arguments
- [ ] Audit all fs.existsSync calls for dynamic arguments
- [ ] Implement path validation and sanitization
- [ ] Test file operations with malicious inputs

### **Phase 2: Object Injection Prevention** (Priority 2)

- [ ] Identify object injection points
- [ ] Implement input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Add property access controls
- [ ] Test with injection payloads

### **Phase 3: DOM Security** (Priority 3)

- [ ] Replace innerHTML with textContent where appropriate
- [ ] Implement HTML sanitization for necessary innerHTML usage
- [ ] Add CSP headers for additional protection
- [ ] Test XSS prevention measures

### **Phase 4: Code Quality** (Priority 4)

- [ ] Address remaining ESLint violations
- [ ] Fix code style inconsistencies
- [ ] Reduce complexity in flagged functions
- [ ] Improve code maintainability scores
