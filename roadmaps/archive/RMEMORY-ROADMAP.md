## ü§ù **Contributing to rMemory**

rMemory is a development tool that enhances AI-assisted development. Contributions should focus on:

- **Memory System Improvements**: Better organization, search, and retrieval
- **Agent Experience Enhancement**: Smoother continuity and context understanding
- **Performance Optimization**: Faster memory access and processing
- **Documentation**: Clear guides for memory system usage and maintenance

**Note**: rMemory enhancements benefit ALL projects using the system, not just HexTrackr.
