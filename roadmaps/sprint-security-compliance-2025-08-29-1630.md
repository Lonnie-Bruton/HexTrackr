# Sprint: Security Compliance & Critical Fixes - 2025-08-29-1630

## 🎯 Sprint Objective

Complete critical security fixes to achieve Codacy compliance and prepare v1.0.3 release. Focus on eliminating 4 critical security vulnerabilities while maintaining existing functionality.

## 📊 Sprint Progress Overview

- **Total Issues Start**: 83 issues (4 critical security)
- **Total Issues Target**: <50 issues (0 critical security)
- **Round 1 Target**: 83 → 60 issues (security fixes)
- **Round 2 Target**: 60 → 40 issues (code quality)
- **Round 3 Target**: 40 → <30 issues (optimization)

## 🚀 Context for Resume

- **Current Branch**: `copilot` (Lonnie-Bruton/HexTrackr)
- **Current Position**: **Round 1, Phase 1** - Security vulnerability fixes
- **Last Completed**: ✅ Documentation restructure (docs-prototype → docs-html)
- **Next Steps**: User selects specific Codacy security issue for targeted fix
- **Git Checkpoint**: `8d52396` - docs-html restructure complete
- **Files Modified**: docs-html/*, server.js, scripts/shared/*, eslint.config.mjs

## 🎯 ROUND 1: Security Vulnerability Fixes

**Goal**: Eliminate all 4 critical security vulnerabilities from Codacy
**Target**: 83 → 60 issues

### ✅ Phase 1: Security Issue Selection (WAITING FOR USER)

**Status**: ⏳ WAITING - User needs to select priority security issue

**Available Security Issues**:

1. **Generic Object Injection Sink** - High severity in `docs-html/generate-docs.js` (formerly docs-prototype)
2. **fs.writeFileSync non-literal arguments** - File system security risk
3. **fs.existsSync non-literal arguments** - File system security risk  
4. **Unsafe innerHTML assignments** - DOM security vulnerability across multiple files

**Selection Process**: User reviews Codacy dashboard → Selects priority issue → AI implements targeted fix

### ⏳ Phase 2: Implementation (PENDING)

**Next Actions**:

- [ ] Implement fix for selected security issue
- [ ] Run Codacy analysis on modified files
- [ ] Verify fix resolves issue without breaking functionality
- [ ] Document security fix approach in ADR

### ⏳ Phase 3: Verification & Testing (PENDING)

**Actions**:

- [ ] Full Codacy analysis to confirm security issue resolution
- [ ] Smoke test affected functionality
- [ ] Update security documentation
- [ ] Commit security fix with proper messaging

## 🎨 ROUND 2: Code Quality Improvements

**Goal**: Reduce remaining code quality issues
**Target**: 60 → 40 issues

### ⏳ Phase 1: Code Style & Best Practices

**Focus Areas**:

- [ ] ESLint rule violations
- [ ] Code complexity reductions  
- [ ] Unused variable cleanup
- [ ] Function naming consistency

### ⏳ Phase 2: Documentation & Comments

**Actions**:

- [ ] Add missing JSDoc comments
- [ ] Update inline documentation
- [ ] Improve code readability

## 🏗️ ROUND 3: Final Optimization

**Goal**: Achieve target of <30 total issues for v1.0.3 release
**Target**: 40 → <30 issues

### ⏳ Phase 1: Performance & Efficiency

**Focus**:

- [ ] Algorithm optimizations
- [ ] Memory usage improvements
