# rMemory Symbol Table Architecture Roadmap 2025

**Date**: August 30, 2025  
**Context**: Post-Symbol Table Breakthrough Integration  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Foundation Complete ‚Üí GUI Interface & Memory Cleanup Phase

---

## üéØ **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

**BREAKTHROUGH ACHIEVED**: Successfully integrated GPT's Memory MCP architecture with Evidence ‚Üí Canonical Notes ‚Üí Todos pipeline. The Symbol Table Processor is operational with deterministic classification + LLM backup, processing Evidence with 0.9 signal strength for ACTION intents.

**NEXT PHASE**: Create GUI management interface, clean old memories, and bulk re-scan chat history with the new Symbol Table approach.

---

## ‚úÖ **COMPLETED FOUNDATION**

### Symbol Table Processor Architecture

- **Evidence Processing**: UUID generation, simhash deduplication, quality scoring
- **Deterministic Classification**: 15 entity types, 5 intent types, 3 confidentiality levels  
- **Database Schema**: SQLite tables (evidence, notes, todos, plans, code_index, classifications)
- **Real-time Integration**: Enhanced scribe with Evidence buffer and 15-min reconciliation
- **GPT Memory MCP**: Complete implementation following provided architecture documents

### Centralized .rMemory Structure

- **Location**: `/Volumes/DATA/GitHub/.rMemory/` (centralized)
- **Project Integration**: Symlink structure for HexTrackr, StackrTrackr, other projects
- **Component Organization**: tools/, scribes/, core/, capture/ folders
- **Legacy Cleanup**: Moved obsolete scripts to archive-pre-symbol-table/

## üéØ **PHASE 3: GUI INTERFACE & MEMORY CLEANUP**

### üñ•Ô∏è **GUI Management Application** (Priority: HIGH)

**Goal**: Create simple desktop application for rMemory system control

**Tech Stack Options**:

- **Python + Tkinter**: Simplest, cross-platform GUI
- **Python + PyQt**: More professional interface  
- **Visual Basic .NET**: Windows-native, rapid development
- **Electron + Node**: Web tech, familiar stack

**Required Features**:

- [ ] **Start/Stop Controls**: Launch/shutdown all rMemory services
- [ ] **Status Indicators**: Real-time service health monitoring
- [ ] **Memory Stats**: Evidence count, classification metrics, storage usage
- [ ] **Quick Actions**: Manual chat scan, memory cleanup, status reports
- [ ] **Log Viewer**: Recent activities and error messages

**Implementation Plan**:

1. [ ] Prototype with Python + Tkinter for speed
2. [ ] Create service management wrapper scripts  
3. [ ] Add status polling via SQLite queries
4. [ ] Package as standalone executable

### üßπ **Memory Cleanup & Re-scanning** (Priority: HIGH)

**Goal**: Clean old memories and rebuild with Symbol Table approach

## Phase 1: Memory Audit & Cleanup

- [ ] **Export Current State**: Backup existing Memento entities before cleanup
- [ ] **Identify Obsolete Data**: Mark old classification approaches for removal
- [ ] **Clean Memento Database**: Remove outdated/incomplete memory entries
- [ ] **Preserve Core Architecture**: Keep essential project structure and relationships

## Phase 2: Bulk Chat History Re-ingestion

- [ ] **Scan Historical Chats**: Find all VS Code chat files since project start
- [ ] **Symbol Table Processing**: Apply Evidence ‚Üí Canonical Notes ‚Üí Todos pipeline
- [ ] **Batch Classification**: Use deterministic + LLM backup on all conversations
- [ ] **Quality Verification**: Ensure classification accuracy with sampling

## Phase 3: Verification & Optimization

- [ ] **Data Quality Audit**: Verify Evidence processing and classification results
- [ ] **Performance Tuning**: Optimize Symbol Table queries and reconciliation cycles
- [ ] **Memory Hierarchy**: Establish proper project:HexTrackr tagging throughout

### üìã **Roadmap Consolidation** (Priority: MEDIUM)

**Current Roadmap Files**:

- ‚úÖ `ROADMAP.md` - Keep (main HexTrackr security/production roadmap)
- ‚ùå `RMEMORY-ROADMAP.md` - Archive (superseded by Symbol Table architecture)
- ‚ùå `SPRINT-COMPREHENSIVE-MEMORY-ARCHITECTURE-2025-08-30.md` - Archive (pre-breakthrough)
- ‚úÖ `SPRINT-LIGHTWEIGHT-MEMORY-ARCHITECTURE-2025-08-30.md` - Keep/Update (user created)
- ‚úÖ `SPRINT-GPT-MEMORY-MCP-INTEGRATION.md` - Keep (Symbol Table foundation)

**Consolidation Tasks**:

- [ ] Archive outdated memory roadmaps to `roadmaps/archive/`
- [ ] Update lightweight architecture sprint with GUI and cleanup phases
- [ ] Create focused rMemory roadmap aligned with Symbol Table breakthrough
- [ ] Document transition from old approach to new Symbol Table schema
