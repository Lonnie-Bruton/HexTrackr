# Vulnerability Management Guide

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD013 -->
The Vulnerability Management interface, available at `vulnerabilities.html`, is designed for tracking and analyzing security vulnerabilities imported from CSV files.

## Importing Vulnerabilities

1. Navigate to the **Vulnerabilities** page.
2. Click Import CSV and choose a vendor export (Cisco/Tenable formats supported). The file is parsed and uploaded to the server.
3. The system records the import (filename, row count) and inserts normalized rows. On success, the grid refreshes.

## Analyzing Vulnerabilities

- The dashboard shows:
  - Counts by severity and VPR totals/averages
  - 14-day trends by severity
- The grid supports:
  - Search (hostname, CVE, plugin name)
  - Severity filter
  - Responsive columns and row selection

## Export and backup

- Use the Settings modal to export vulnerabilities (JSON/CSV) or take a complete backup. Restore via a zip containing tickets.json and/or vulnerabilities.json.
