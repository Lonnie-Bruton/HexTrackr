# Memory Archaeology Handoff - January 29, 2025

## HANDOFF CONTEXT

- **Session Intent**: Execute agent-project-playbook-v2.prompt.md protocol and continue Epic 2 (rMemory Scribe Integration)
- **Immediate State**: Chat Log Archaeology Tool ready for execution to process 236MB VS Code chat history
- **Critical Path**: Complete memory reconstruction to solve "context restart every 20 minutes" problem

## TECHNICAL STATE OVERVIEW

### Epic 2 Progress - rMemory Scribe Integration

- **Task 2.1.1**: âœ… Extract rMemory components - PARTIALLY COMPLETE
  - rEngine-main.zip extracted and analyzed in `docs/agents/rEngine-main/`
  - Core rMemory patterns identified from original "failed prototype"
  - Chat Log Archaeology system architecture designed and implemented

### Memory Reconstruction System (Ready to Execute)

```
scripts/
â”œâ”€â”€ chat-log-archaeology.js    # Historical processing tool (236MB chat history)
â”œâ”€â”€ chat-log-monitor.js        # Real-time monitoring (potentially redundant)
â”œâ”€â”€ memory-importer.js         # Memento MCP integration bridge
â”œâ”€â”€ memory-scribe.js           # Adapted from rEngine rMemory patterns
â””â”€â”€ context-lifecycle.js       # rMemory context management patterns
```

### VS Code Chat History Discovery

- **Location**: `/Users/lonnie/Library/Application Support/Code/logs/20250816T221719/window1/exthost/output_logging_20250816T221719/`
- **Size**: 236MB across 9 major sessions (August 16-17)
- **Sessions**:
  - `GitHub Copilot [2024-08-16 22:18:18]` - 48MB (initial development)
  - `GitHub Copilot [2024-08-16 23:14:27]` - 31MB (core architecture)
  - `GitHub Copilot [2024-08-17 00:30:41]` - 29MB (database implementation)
  - `GitHub Copilot [2024-08-17 01:47:30]` - 28MB (UI development)
  - Additional sessions: 25MB, 24MB, 22MB, 17MB, 12MB

## ARCHITECTURE VALIDATED

### Memory Flow (User Confirmed)

```
VS Code Chat Sessions â†’ Ollama Processing â†’ Local Files â†’ Memento MCP â†’ Neo4j Memory Graph
```

### Division of Labor (Clarified)

- **Chat Log Archaeology Tool**: One-time historical recovery from 236MB backlog
- **Ollama Scribe**: Ongoing real-time monitoring of new VS Code sessions
- **Protocols**: Existing `.prompts` directory replaces rMemory's 27 numbered protocols

## TOOLS OPERATIONAL STATUS

### Ollama Integration âœ…

- qwen2.5-coder model pulled and operational
- ollama-detector.js confirms installation
- Configured for chat log analysis and entity extraction

### Memento MCP âœ…

- Neo4j-backed persistent memory system
- Semantic search with vector embeddings
- Entity and relationship management ready

### rEngine Components âœ…

- Original rMemory architecture extracted and analyzed
- Core patterns adapted for HexTrackr integration
- Key files: context-lifecycle.js, conversation-bridge.js, search-matrix patterns

## CRITICAL EXECUTION PLAN

### Immediate Next Steps (Epic 2 Task 2.1.1 Completion)

1. **Execute Chat Log Archaeology**: Process 236MB VS Code history

   ```bash
   cd /Volumes/DATA/GitHub/HexTrackr
   node scripts/chat-log-archaeology.js
   ```

1. **Validate Memory Reconstruction**: Verify complete project context recovery

1. **Implement Ollama Scribe**: Real-time monitoring for new chat sessions

1. **Test Memory Persistence**: Confirm Memento MCP integration working

### Expected Outcomes

- Complete project memory reconstruction from August development sessions
- Elimination of "context restart every 20 minutes" problem
- Operational rMemory-inspired scribe system for HexTrackr
- Rolling context preservation across all future sessions

## ROADMAP INTEGRATION

### Completed Epics

- âœ… Epic 1: Ollama Detection & Integration
- âœ… Claude-4 Upgrade for premium analysis capabilities

### Active Epic

- ðŸ”„ Epic 2: rMemory Scribe Integration (Final phase - memory reconstruction)

### Next Epic

- ðŸ“‹ Epic 3: Advanced Memory Features (search, timeline, relationship mapping)

## TECHNICAL DEPENDENCIES

### File System Paths

- Project Root: `/Volumes/DATA/GitHub/HexTrackr`
- Chat History: `/Users/lonnie/Library/Application Support/Code/logs/20250816T221719/window1/exthost/output_logging_20250816T221719/`
- rEngine Archive: `docs/agents/rEngine-main/`
- Scripts: `scripts/`

### External Services

- Ollama: Local LLM processing (qwen2.5-coder)
- Memento MCP: Neo4j memory persistence
- VS Code: Chat session source

## CONVERSATION HIGHLIGHTS

### Key User Insights

- "The protocols we kind of already have established with the .prompts we are using now, don't you think?" - Architectural validation
- "check the agents folder, i left you a package :)" - Directed to rEngine-main.zip
- "Let's make a comprehensive handoff and start a new chat first. This could get long" - Session management preparation

### Architecture Clarification

- User confirmed understanding of memory flow and tool division
- Validated that Chat Log Archaeology handles historical data
- Confirmed Ollama Scribe handles ongoing monitoring
- Approved elimination of redundant chat-log-monitor.js in favor of dedicated Ollama scribe

## EXECUTION READINESS CHECKLIST

- âœ… Chat Log Archaeology Tool implemented and ready
- âœ… Ollama qwen2.5-coder model operational
- âœ… Memento MCP integration prepared
- âœ… VS Code chat history located (236MB)
- âœ… rEngine components extracted and analyzed
- âœ… User validated architecture and approach
- âœ… Comprehensive handoff documentation created

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### Must Complete

1. Process all 236MB of VS Code chat history
2. Extract and store complete project timeline
3. Populate Memento memory graph with entities and relationships
4. Verify rolling context functionality

### Quality Measures

- No data loss from historical chat sessions
- Complete entity extraction (files, functions, decisions, patterns)
- Searchable memory graph with semantic relationships
- Elimination of context restart problem

---

**Ready for execution**: Epic 2 Task 2.1.1 final phase - comprehensive memory reconstruction from 236MB VS Code chat history to establish persistent project memory and solve context continuity challenges.
