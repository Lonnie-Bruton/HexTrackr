# Agents Operations Log

Date | Agent | Branch | Actions | Files | Decisions/ADRs | Follow-ups
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
2025-08-29 | engineering-agent | chore/memento-mcp-setup | Initialize memory MCP and playbook scaffolding | .vscode/settings.json; docs/agents/AGENTS.md | ADR-0001 | Verify MCP server availability and DB path
2025-08-29 | engineering-agent | chore/memento-mcp-setup | Added ops log, ADR, prompt templates; linted edited files; attempted memento-mcp startup | docs/ops/AGENTS_LOG.md; docs/adr/ADR-0001-memory-backend.md; .prompts/memory-first-search.prompt.md; .prompts/summarize-and-link.prompt.md | ADR-0001 | memento-mcp not found via npm; confirm correct package or provide install path; consider fallback local memory store
2025-08-29 | engineering-agent | chore/memento-mcp-setup | Updated MCP config to use @gannonh/memento-mcp; added env passthrough placeholders | .vscode/settings.json | ADR-0001 | Set NEO4J and OPENAI env vars; validate npx server starts; then migrate from local fallback
2025-08-29 | Memento MCP Setup | Installed @gannonh/memento-mcp v0.3.9, configured VS Code settings, set environment variables, verified Neo4j connection working | Need to test memory write operations following AGENTS.md protocol | Next: Follow 7-step turn loop properly
2025-08-29 | GitHub Copilot | chore/memento-mcp-setup | Discovered protocol violation: Agent not following AGENTS.md 7-step turn loop, missing memory recording (step 6 map-update) | AGENTS.md review | Protocol compliance required for memory system activation | Follow AGENTS.md protocol properly to populate Neo4j database
2025-08-29 | GitHub Copilot | chore/memento-mcp-setup | Used Copilot MCP extension to properly install @gannonh/memento-mcp via NPM Package option, resolved manual configuration issues | MCP extension UI, mcp.json auto-config | Proper MCP server management through VS Code extensions | Test memory tools availability and verify Neo4j integration
2025-08-29 | GitHub Copilot | chore/memento-mcp-setup | Created developer-only MCP automation setup: docker-compose.dev.yml, start/stop scripts, documentation | docker-compose.dev.yml, scripts/start-dev-env.sh, scripts/stop-dev-env.sh, docs/development/dev-environment.md, .gitignore | Developer environment isolated from production, excluded from public pushes | Restart VS Code to test full MCP integration, verify memento tools availability
2025-08-29 | GitHub Copilot | chore/memento-mcp-setup | ✅ MEMENTO MCP INTEGRATION COMPLETE: All memory tools functional, first entities created, Neo4j Desktop connected to Docker database | Neo4j memory graph, mcp.json configuration | Full agent memory system operational using default neo4j database | Begin using memory-first workflows per AGENTS.md protocol
2025-08-29 | GitHub Copilot | chore/memento-mcp-setup | Updated root AGENTS.md with proper 7-step turn loop protocol, replaced old compliance loop with memory-first workflow | AGENTS.md complete rewrite | Enforced proper agent protocols for all future development, memento-mcp as primary memory backend | All agents must now follow 7-step protocol: observe→plan→safeguards→execute→verify→map-update→log
