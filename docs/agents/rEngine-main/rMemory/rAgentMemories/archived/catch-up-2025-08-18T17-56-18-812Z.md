}

Next Logical Steps:

1. Review the recent file modifications to ensure no critical changes have been made.
2. Analyze the system state to identify any potential issues or areas for improvement.
3. Document notable decisions made during this session, along with their reasoning.

Pending Items:

1. Investigate the review of memory-sync-manager.js and its implications on system performance.
2. Review the checklist.md file to ensure all necessary tasks are completed.

Critical Information for Seamless Continuation:

1. The current system state is stable, but it's essential to monitor any changes in the future.
2. User preferences observed during this session indicate a focus on optimizing memory usage and improving system performance.
3. Technical context suggests that recent decisions were made based on the need to address security vulnerabilities and improve data presentation.

By following these steps and considering the critical information, you'll be able to seamlessly continue the project and ensure its success.
