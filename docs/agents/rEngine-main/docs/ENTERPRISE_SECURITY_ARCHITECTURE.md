# Enterprise Security & Memory Architecture Specification

## Overview

This document outlines the technical implementation of two critical enterprise features:

1. **Per-Project Memory Architecture**: Isolated memory contexts per git repository
2. **Git Security Model**: Docker-based repository sandboxing with working branch workflows

## 1. Per-Project Memory Architecture

### Core Concept

Each git repository gets its own isolated memory context, preventing cross-project contamination while maintaining core platform traits and knowledge.

### Technical Implementation

#### Memory Context Structure

```javascript
// Memory context per repository
{
  repositoryId: "unique-repo-hash",
  projectName: "user-defined-name",
  isolatedMemory: {
    conversationHistory: [],
    codebaseKnowledge: {},
    patterns: {},
    customInstructions: {}
  },
  inheritedTraits: {
    coreKnowledge: "reference-only",
    platformCapabilities: "reference-only",
    userPreferences: "reference-only"
  },
  accessControl: {
    roles: ["owner", "collaborator", "viewer"],
    permissions: {}
  }
}
```

#### Implementation Strategy

1. **Repository Detection**: Git repository root detection via `.git` folder
2. **Context Switching**: Automatic memory context switching based on active repository
3. **Inheritance Model**: Core traits inherited by reference (not copied)
4. **Noise Reduction**: Project-specific learning doesn't pollute other projects

#### Key Features

- **Zero Cross-Contamination**: Project A's patterns never affect Project B
- **Smart Inheritance**: Core platform knowledge available but not modifiable per-project
- **Role-Based Access**: Multiple users can access project memory with appropriate permissions
- **Context Persistence**: Project memory persists across sessions

### Storage Architecture

```
memory/
├── core/                    # Platform-wide knowledge (read-only reference)
│   ├── traits.json
│   ├── capabilities.json
│   └── user-preferences.json
├── projects/               # Per-project isolated contexts
│   ├── {repo-hash-1}/
│   │   ├── memory.json
│   │   ├── patterns.json
│   │   └── access-control.json
│   └── {repo-hash-2}/
│       ├── memory.json
│       ├── patterns.json
│       └── access-control.json
└── index.json             # Repository mapping and metadata
```

## 2. Git Security Model

### Core Concept (2)

All AI-generated changes are made in isolated Docker containers with fresh repository pulls, requiring explicit user approval before merging to main branch.

### Security Workflow

#### Phase 1: Repository Sandboxing

1. **Fresh Pull**: Clone latest repository state into isolated Docker container
2. **Working Branch**: Create uniquely named working branch (e.g., `ai-changes-{timestamp}`)
3. **Environment Isolation**: AI operates only within sandboxed container environment
4. **No Direct Main Access**: AI cannot directly modify main/master branches

#### Phase 2: Change Implementation

1. **Isolated Development**: AI implements changes in working branch within container
2. **Change Tracking**: All modifications tracked with detailed commit messages
3. **Diff Generation**: Enhanced diff visualization showing all proposed changes
4. **Security Validation**: Automated security scans on proposed changes

#### Phase 3: Approval Workflow

1. **Pull Request Creation**: AI creates PR with comprehensive change summary
2. **Enhanced Review UI**: Rich diff viewer with security annotations
3. **User Approval Required**: No changes merge without explicit user approval
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all AI-proposed changes and decisions

### Technical Implementation (2)

#### Docker Container Configuration

```dockerfile

# Isolated AI development environment

FROM node:18-alpine
RUN adduser -D -s /bin/sh aidev
USER aidev
WORKDIR /workspace

# Security: No network access except git operations

# Security: Read-only filesystem except /workspace

# Security: Limited CPU/memory resources

```

#### Working Branch Automation

```javascript
// Automated branch management
const createWorkingBranch = async (repoPath) => {
  const timestamp = Date.now();
  const branchName = `ai-changes-${timestamp}`;
  
  await git.checkout('-b', branchName);
  await git.push('origin', branchName);
  
  return {
    branchName,
    containerPath: `/workspace/${branchName}`,
    securityIsolation: true
  };
};
```

#### Merge Approval System

```javascript
// Enhanced approval workflow
const createApprovalRequest = async (changes) => {
  return {
    pullRequestId: await createPR(changes),
    securityScan: await runSecurityScan(changes),
    diffVisualization: await generateEnhancedDiff(changes),
    approvalRequired: true,
    autoMerge: false
  };
};
```

## 3. Integration Architecture

### Memory + Security Integration

The per-project memory system works seamlessly with git security:

1. **Context Awareness**: Memory context switches automatically based on repository
2. **Security Boundaries**: Memory isolation reinforces git security boundaries  
3. **Audit Integration**: Memory access events logged alongside git security events
4. **Cross-System Consistency**: Same repository boundaries for both memory and security

- **Repository Pollution**: Fresh pulls prevent contaminated environments
- **Approval Bypass**: Technical enforcement prevents approval circumvention

### Performance Risks  

- **Memory Overhead**: Efficient context switching and storage optimization
- **Container Startup**: Pre-warmed containers and fast provisioning
- **Storage Growth**: Automated cleanup and archival systems

### User Experience Risks

- **Workflow Friction**: Streamlined approval UI with one-click approvals
- **Context Confusion**: Clear visual indicators of active project context
- **Learning Curve**: Progressive disclosure and guided onboarding
