COLLECT BUTTON TOGGLE ISSUE ANALYSIS REQUEST

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
We have an oddity with collect button toggle links where something is causing them not to match. The user suspects it might be something to do with the objects and not the actual table colors, possibly a semi-transparent overlay of a button that we are missing.

RELEVANT FILES TO ANALYZE:
1. /Volumes/DATA/GitHub/StackTrackr/rProjects/StackTrackr/css/styles.css - Main styling
2. /Volumes/DATA/GitHub/StackTrackr/rProjects/StackTrackr/js/events.js - Event handling for toggles
3. /Volumes/DATA/GitHub/StackTrackr/rProjects/StackTrackr/js/inventory.js - Inventory management
4. /Volumes/DATA/GitHub/StackTrackr/rProjects/StackTrackr/index.html - HTML structure

SPECIFIC ANALYSIS NEEDED:
- Look for collect button styling inconsistencies
- Check for semi-transparent overlays or hidden elements
- Analyze toggle state management
- Identify potential color matching issues
- Look for CSS conflicts or specificity problems
- Check for JavaScript event handling issues
- Examine button state synchronization

FOCUS AREAS:
- Button appearance vs functionality mismatch
- Overlay elements that might interfere with visual feedback
- CSS specificity conflicts
- JavaScript state management for toggles
- Color inheritance or override issues

Please provide a comprehensive analysis with specific code references and recommendations.
