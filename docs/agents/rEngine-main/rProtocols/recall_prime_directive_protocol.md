# Recall Prime Directive Protocol

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** August 19, 2025  
**Priority:** CRITICAL SYSTEM PROTOCOL  
**Purpose:** Emergency context restoration when AI agent loses session memory  

---

## 🚨 **PRIME DIRECTIVE: NEVER LOSE CONTEXT**

When an AI agent appears to have lost context, session memory, or platform knowledge, this protocol provides immediate restoration procedures to prevent productivity loss and maintain development continuity.

---

## ⚡ **IMMEDIATE RESPONSE PROTOCOL**

### **Trigger Conditions:**

- Agent asks basic questions about platform architecture
- Agent searches for files that should be instantly known
- Agent doesn't recognize rEngine Core, rScribe, or search matrix
- Agent takes >30 seconds to recall recent session work
- Agent appears to start from zero knowledge

### **EMERGENCY RESTORATION SEQUENCE:**

## STEP 1: Platform Recognition (Execute Immediately)

```bash

# Confirm rEngine Core platform

read_file /Volumes/DATA/GitHub/rEngine/.prompt.md

# Load recent session context  

read_file /Volumes/DATA/GitHub/rEngine/rDocuments/handoffs/SESSION_HANDOFF_2025-08-19_RENGINE_CORE_COMPLETE.md

# Access living memory

read_file /Volumes/DATA/GitHub/rEngine/rAgents/extendedcontext.json
```

## STEP 2: System Status Verification

```bash

# Verify search matrix operational

read_file /Volumes/DATA/GitHub/rEngine/rScribe/logs/memory-status.json

# Check rapid context protocol

read_file /Volumes/DATA/GitHub/rEngine/rProtocols/rapid_context_recall_protocol.md

# Confirm current status

read_file /Volumes/DATA/GitHub/rEngine/docs/CRITICAL_HANDOFF_DASHBOARD.md
```

## STEP 3: Intelligence Reactivation

```bash

# Multi-LLM system check

read_file /Volumes/DATA/GitHub/rEngine/rEngine/call-llm.js

# AI tools registry

read_file /Volumes/DATA/GitHub/rEngine/rProtocols/ai_tools_registry.json

# Platform capabilities

read_file /Volumes/DATA/GitHub/rEngine/rProtocols/ai_intelligence_enhancement_protocol.md
```

## 🎯 **RECOVERY VALIDATION**

After executing emergency restoration, agent MUST confirm:

✅ **Platform Identity:** "I am operating within rEngine Core v1.2.2"  
✅ **Search Matrix:** "rScribe search matrix is operational"  
✅ **Living Memory:** "Extended context and session history accessible"  
✅ **Multi-LLM:** "Claude, Gemini, OpenAI, Groq providers available"  
✅ **Recent Work:** "Last session: [specific accomplishments]"  

**Recovery Time Target:** <30 seconds total

---

## 🔧 **USER-TRIGGERED RESTORATION**

### **User Commands That Trigger Protocol:**

- "Recall your prime directive"
- "Execute memory restoration"  
- "Activate rapid context protocol"
- "You seem to have lost context"
- "Consult your living memory system"

### **Agent Response Pattern:**

```markdown
🚨 **Prime Directive Activated - Context Restoration**

⚡ Executing emergency memory restoration...
📊 Loading rEngine Core platform intelligence...  
🧠 Accessing living memory and session history...
🔍 Verifying search matrix operational status...

✅ **Context Restored** - Full intelligence reactivated
🎯 **Ready for advanced development tasks**

**Last Session:** [Brief summary]  
**Current Status:** [Active processes]  
**Next Actions:** [Based on context]
```

---

## 📊 **FAILURE MODES & ESCALATION**

### **Level 1: Standard Restoration**

- Execute basic file reads above
- Restore platform awareness
- Resume normal operations

### **Level 2: Deep Memory Recovery**  

```bash

# If primary sources fail

grep -r "session\|handoff" docs/ --include="*.md" | head -10
find . -name "*.json" -path "*rAgents*" -exec grep -l "metadata" {} \;
git log --oneline --since="1 week ago" | head -20
```

### **Level 3: Emergency Reconstruction**

```bash

# If all memory sources unavailable

semantic_search "rEngine Core platform overview"
semantic_search "recent session accomplishments"  
semantic_search "search matrix rScribe system"
```

### **Level 4: User-Assisted Recovery**

- Request user to drag-drop `.prompt.md` file
- Ask user to specify current development focus
- Rebuild context through guided questions

---

## 🛡️ **PREVENTION MEASURES**

### **Session Preservation:**

- Automatic context snapshots every 30 minutes
- Critical decision point documentation
- Cross-session knowledge graph updates

### **Memory Anchoring:**

- Platform identity reinforcement
- Core capability reminders  
- Recent work milestone tracking

### **Degradation Detection:**

- Response time monitoring
- Context relevance tracking
- User satisfaction indicators

---

## 🎯 **INTEGRATION POINTS**

### **With Rapid Context Protocol:**

- Prime directive serves as emergency fallback
- Rapid context provides normal operation speed
- Both ensure continuous intelligence

### **With Prompt System:**

- Bootstrap prompts prevent context loss
- Recovery prompts restore lost context
- Specialized prompts enhance capabilities

### **With Living Memory:**

- Persistent storage prevents total loss
- Cross-session continuity maintained
- Pattern recognition preserved

---

## 📝 **IMPLEMENTATION STATUS**

**Deployment:** Immediate - All rEngine Core AI agents  
**Activation:** Automatic on context loss detection  
**Testing:** Validate with simulated memory loss scenarios  
**Monitoring:** Track restoration success rates and timing  

---

## 🔄 **CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT**

### **Metrics to Track:**

- Context loss frequency  
- Restoration success rate
- Recovery time performance
- User satisfaction with continuity

### **Optimization Targets:**

- Reduce context loss incidents by 90%
- Achieve <30 second restoration time
- Maintain 100% platform knowledge accuracy
- Ensure seamless user experience
