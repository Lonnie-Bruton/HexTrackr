# ⚠️ DEPRECATED SCRIPTS

These scripts have been moved to the `robust-startup-package` folder for organization.

## 🚀 Use Instead

- `../robust-startup-package/robust-startup-protocol.sh` - Main startup
- `../robust-startup-package/quick-start-enhanced.sh` - Quick launch  
- `../robust-startup-package/emergency-recovery.sh` - Recovery mode

## 📋 Organization Strategy

All operating system level scripts are now centralized in `robust-startup-package/`
to prepare for multi-IDE expansion (VS Code → Cursor → IntelliJ) as per roadmap.

## 🗑️ Safe to Delete

These deprecated scripts can be safely deleted after confirming the new
organized versions work correctly.
