# Dashboard Server

This script sets up a simple web server to serve a static HTML dashboard. It leverages Node.js and potentially an external web framework (currently none is used).  It is intended to be used as a quick and easy way to view locally generated HTML reports or dashboards without complex deployment procedures.

## How to Use

Currently, the script is placeholder and does no actions.  Future versions will include command line arguments and a web server implementation.  A hypothetical example follows assuming these features are implemented.

## Example (Hypothetical):

To start the server on port 8080, serving files from the "dashboard" directory, you would execute the following command in your terminal, within the directory where `dashboard-server.js` is located:

```bash
node dashboard-server.js --port 8080 --directory dashboard
```

## Core Logic Breakdown

This script is currently a placeholder.  Future iterations will include the following functionalities:

1. **Command-Line Argument Parsing:** It will parse command-line arguments to determine the port number and directory to serve.
2. **Web Server Initialization:** It will initialize a web server using Node.js's built-in `http` or `https` modules or an external framework like Express.js.
3. **Static File Serving:** It will serve static HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image files from the specified directory.
4. **Request Handling:**  It will handle incoming HTTP requests and route them to the appropriate files.
5. **Error Handling:**  It will include error handling for file not found, server errors, etc.

## Configuration & Dependencies

This script currently has no external dependencies. In future implementations, it may use packages like `express` for more advanced web server features.  It does not utilize any configuration files at this time. Future versions may introduce a configuration file to manage port numbers, directories, and other settings.
