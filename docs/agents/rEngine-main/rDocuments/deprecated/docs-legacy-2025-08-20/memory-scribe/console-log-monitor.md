# Console Log Monitor

This script provides a basic framework for monitoring console logs in real-time. While currently a placeholder, it is designed to be extended to filter, analyze, and react to specific log patterns, making it a valuable tool for debugging and monitoring applications.  It currently outputs a simple message to the console.

## How to Use

This script is designed to be run directly from the command line using Node.js.  Currently, there are no command-line arguments or external dependencies.

## Example:

```bash
node console-log-monitor.js
```

## Core Logic Breakdown

The script currently executes a single console log statement.  Future development will include functionalities for reading external log files, filtering log messages based on specific criteria (e.g., log level, timestamps), and potentially triggering actions based on detected patterns. This could include sending notifications, updating dashboards, or even dynamically adjusting application behavior.

The expected workflow will involve:

1. **Input:** Receiving a stream of log messages, either from the console or a log file.
2. **Processing:** Filtering and analyzing the log messages based on predefined rules.
3. **Output:** Generating alerts, reports, or other actions based on the processed logs.

## Configuration & Dependencies

Currently, this script has no external dependencies or configuration files.  Future versions might leverage npm packages for log parsing, filtering, and output formatting.  Configuration options might be introduced via command-line arguments or a dedicated configuration file (e.g., `config.json`) to define log sources, filters, and output destinations.
