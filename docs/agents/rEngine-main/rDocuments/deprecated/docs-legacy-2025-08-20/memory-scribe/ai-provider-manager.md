# AI Provider Manager

This script manages the interaction with different AI providers, abstracting away the provider-specific details and providing a unified interface for accessing AI functionalities. It allows developers to easily switch between providers without modifying their core application logic.

## How to Use

The script is designed to be run from the command line. Currently, as the script is empty, there are no arguments or specific execution instructions.  Future versions will include the ability to specify the AI provider and the desired action.

## Example (Placeholder for future functionality):

```bash
node ai-provider-manager.js --provider openai --action generateText --prompt "Hello, world!"
```

## Core Logic Breakdown

Currently, the script contains no executable code. Future iterations will include the core logic for managing AI providers.  This will involve:

1. **Provider Abstraction:** Defining a common interface for interacting with different AI providers.
2. **Provider Selection:** Implementing logic to select the appropriate provider based on user input or configuration.
3. **Request Handling:** Formatting requests according to the chosen provider's API specifications.
4. **Response Processing:** Parsing and standardizing the responses received from the providers.

## Configuration & Dependencies

Currently, the script has no external dependencies or configuration files. Future versions will likely utilize npm packages for interacting with specific AI provider APIs (e.g., `openai`, `cohere-ai`, etc.). Configuration will likely be managed through a configuration file (e.g., `config.json`) or environment variables, allowing users to specify API keys and other provider-specific settings.
