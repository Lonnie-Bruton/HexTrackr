# AI-Powered Search Engine Prototype

## Purpose & Overview

This script is a prototype for enhancing the existing search functionality of the StackTrackr application with AI-powered natural language interpretation. The primary goal is to provide users with more accurate and relevant search results by leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4.

The prototype demonstrates how the existing sophisticated search system can be augmented with AI, while maintaining backward compatibility with the traditional search approach. This allows the application to take advantage of the improved search quality offered by AI-powered interpretation, without disrupting the existing user experience.

## Technical Architecture

The key components of the AI-powered search engine are:

1. **AISearchEngine Class**: This class encapsulates the AI-enhanced search functionality and integrates with the existing StackTrackr search system.
2. **Configuration (AI_SEARCH_CONFIG)**: This object holds various settings and parameters for the AI search engine, including model selection, caching strategy, and search enhancement options.
3. **Interpretation Workflow**:
   - The `enhanceSearch` method is the main entry point, which checks the cache for previous results before calling the `interpretQuery` method.
   - The `interpretQuery` method generates a context-aware prompt and sends it to the GPT API to obtain the AI interpretation of the user's query.
   - The `mergeResults` method combines the traditional search results with the AI-discovered matches, handling duplicate items and maintaining a consistent output structure.
1. **Caching and Cost Optimization**: The script leverages a cache to store previous AI search results, improving response times and reducing API costs.
2. **Error Handling**: The prototype includes graceful fallback to the traditional search approach in case of any errors during the AI interpretation process.

## Dependencies

This script requires the following dependencies:

1. **GPT API**: The script uses the GPT API (e.g., OpenAI's API) to generate AI-powered search interpretations. Access to a valid API key is required.

## Key Functions/Classes

### `AISearchEngine` Class

**Constructor**:

- `constructor(apiKey, model = AI_SEARCH_CONFIG.models.primary)`: Initializes the AISearchEngine instance with the provided API key and model selection.

**Methods**:

- `enhanceSearch(query, inventory, traditionalResults)`: Enhances the existing search results with AI-powered interpretation. It checks the cache, calls the GPT API, merges the results, and caches the final response.
- `interpretQuery(query, inventory)`: Generates an AI interpretation of the user's query using the provided inventory context.
- `buildSearchPrompt(query, inventory)`: Constructs a context-aware prompt for the GPT API based on the user's query and the available inventory.
- `extractInventoryContext(inventory)`: Extracts relevant inventory information (e.g., unique names, metals, types) to optimize the search prompt.
- `callGPTAPI(prompt)`: Sends the prompt to the GPT API and handles any errors or retries.
- `parseAIResponse(responseText)`: Parses and validates the response from the GPT API.
- `mergeResults(traditionalResults, aiInterpretation, inventory)`: Combines the traditional search results with the AI-discovered matches, handling duplicates and providing a consistent output structure.
- `findAIMatches(aiInterpretation, inventory)`: Finds additional matches in the inventory based on the AI interpretation.
- `fuzzyMatch(needle, haystack)`: Performs fuzzy string matching, including handling of common abbreviations and typos.
- `levenshteinDistance(str1, str2)`: Calculates the Levenshtein distance between two strings for fuzzy matching.
- `generateCacheKey(query, inventorySize)`: Generates a cache key based on the search query and inventory size.
- `cacheResult(key, result)`: Stores the search result in the cache with a time-to-live (TTL) management.

## Usage Examples

To use the AI-powered search engine, you can create an instance of the `AISearchEngine` class and call the `enhanceSearch` method:

```javascript
const apiKey = 'your_gpt_api_key';
const searchEngine = new AISearchEngine(apiKey);

const query = 'silver american eagle';
const inventory = [
  { name: 'American Silver Eagle', metal: 'Silver', type: 'Coin', composition: '99.9% Silver' },
  { name: 'Canadian Maple Leaf', metal: 'Gold', type: 'Coin', composition: '99.99% Gold' },
  // ... more inventory items
];

const traditionalResults = [
  { name: 'American Silver Eagle', serial: 'ASE123', price: 25.99 },
  // ... traditional search results
];

const enhancedResults = await searchEngine.enhanceSearch(query, inventory, traditionalResults);
console.log(enhancedResults);
```

## Configuration

The `AI_SEARCH_CONFIG` object holds the following configuration options:

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `models` | An object that specifies the primary, fallback, and premium GPT models to use based on cost optimization. |
| `cache` | An object that configures the caching strategy, including time-to-live (TTL) and maximum cache size. |
| `search` | An object that sets the confidence threshold for AI suggestions, the maximum number of suggestions, and whether to fallback to traditional search. |

## Error Handling

The `AISearchEngine` class handles errors that may occur during the AI interpretation process. If an error occurs, the class will log the error and gracefully fall back to the traditional search results, returning an object with the following properties:

- `results`: The traditional search results.
- `aiEnhanced`: `false`, indicating that the results were not AI-enhanced.
- `error`: The error message.
- `suggestions`: An empty array, as no AI suggestions are available.

## Integration

The AI-powered search engine prototype is designed to integrate with the existing StackTrackr search functionality. It can be seamlessly integrated by calling the `enhanceSearch` method, which will provide enhanced search results that combine the traditional search and the AI-powered interpretation.

## Development Notes

- The script uses the Levenshtein distance algorithm for fuzzy string matching, which provides a reasonable balance between performance and accuracy.
- The cache implementation is a simple in-memory Map, which may need to be replaced with a more robust solution (e.g., using a persistent cache) for production use.
- The script assumes that the traditional search results are already available and passed to the `enhanceSearch` method. In a real-world scenario, the integration with the existing search system would need to be carefully designed.
- The script uses a fixed temperature setting (0.3) for the GPT API to ensure consistent and predictable results. Depending on the use case, this parameter may need to be adjusted.
- The script does not handle edge cases such as very large inventories or queries that exceed the GPT API's maximum token limit. Additional error handling and scaling considerations may be required.

## Chunk 2 Analysis

# AI Search Prototype Documentation

## Purpose & Overview (2)

This script is a prototype for integrating an AI-powered search engine into an existing "StackTrackr" search system. It provides an `AISearchEngine` class that handles caching, loading, and saving of search results, as well as an `enhanceExistingSearch` function that enhances the existing `filterInventory` function with AI-generated suggestions and insights.

The primary goal of this script is to leverage AI capabilities to improve the accuracy and relevance of search results, providing a better user experience for the StackTrackr application.

## Technical Architecture (2)

The script consists of the following key components:

1. **`AISearchEngine` Class**:
   - Responsible for managing the cache of search results, including loading, saving, and cleaning up expired entries.
   - Provides methods for enhancing search results using AI capabilities.

1. **`enhanceExistingSearch` Function**:
   - Integrates the `AISearchEngine` with the existing `filterInventory` function.
   - Checks if AI is enabled and configured, and if so, uses the `AISearchEngine` to enhance the search results.
   - Handles errors gracefully and falls back to the traditional search if the AI enhancement fails.

1. **`displayAIInsights` Function**:
   - Responsible for rendering the AI-generated insights and suggestions in the user interface.
   - Updates or creates an "AI Insights" panel and attaches event listeners to the suggestion chips.

The overall data flow is as follows:

1. The `enhanceExistingSearch` function is called when the user performs a search.
2. The function checks if AI is enabled and configured, and if so, it initializes the `AISearchEngine` (if not already done).
3. The `AISearchEngine` is used to enhance the traditional search results, leveraging AI capabilities.
4. The enhanced results, along with AI-generated insights and suggestions, are returned and displayed in the user interface by the `displayAIInsights` function.

## Dependencies (2)

The script does not have any external dependencies. It uses the following browser APIs and global variables:

- `localStorage`: Used to persist the search result cache.
- `window.aiSearchEnabled`: A global flag indicating whether the AI search feature is enabled.
- `window.aiApiKey`: The API key required for the AI search functionality.
- `window.filterInventory`: The existing search function to be enhanced.
- `window.searchQuery` and `window.inventory`: Global variables used by the existing search system.

## Key Functions/Classes (2)

### `AISearchEngine` Class (2)

**Constructor**:

- `constructor(apiKey: string)`: Initializes the `AISearchEngine` with the provided API key.

**Cache Management**:

- `loadCacheFromStorage()`: Loads the search result cache from localStorage.
- `saveCacheToStorage()`: Saves the search result cache to localStorage.
- `cleanupCache()`: Removes expired entries from the cache and enforces the maximum cache size.

**Search Enhancement**:

- `enhanceSearch(query: string, inventory: any[], traditionalResults: any[])`: Enhances the traditional search results using AI capabilities. Returns the enhanced results, along with AI-generated insights and suggestions.

### `enhanceExistingSearch` Function

- `enhanceExistingSearch()`: Integrates the `AISearchEngine` with the existing `filterInventory` function. Checks if AI is enabled and configured, and if so, uses the `AISearchEngine` to enhance the search results. Handles errors and falls back to the traditional search if necessary.

### `displayAIInsights` Function

- `displayAIInsights(aiInterpretation: object)`: Renders the AI-generated insights and suggestions in the user interface, creating or updating an "AI Insights" panel.

## Usage Examples (2)

1. Enabling AI-enhanced search:

```javascript
// Set the necessary global variables
window.aiSearchEnabled = true;
window.aiApiKey = 'your-ai-api-key';

// Use the enhanced search function
const results = await enhanceExistingSearch();
```

1. Interacting with the AI insights:

```html
<!-- The search input -->
<input type="text" id="searchInput" />

<!-- The AI insights panel will be inserted here -->
<div id="ai-insights-panel"></div>
```

When the user performs a search, the `enhanceExistingSearch` function will be called, and the `displayAIInsights` function will render the AI-generated insights and suggestions in the "AI Insights" panel. Users can click on the suggestion chips to update the search query and trigger a new search.

## Configuration (2)

The script uses the following configuration options, which are defined in the `AI_SEARCH_CONFIG` object:

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `cache.storageKey` | The key used to store the search result cache in localStorage. |
| `cache.maxSize` | The maximum number of entries to keep in the cache. |
| `cache.ttl` | The time-to-live (in milliseconds) for each cache entry. |

These configuration options can be modified as needed to adjust the cache behavior.

## Error Handling (2)

The script handles the following potential errors:

1. **Failed to load cache from localStorage**: Logs a warning message and continues with an empty cache.
2. **Failed to save cache to localStorage**: Logs a warning message and continues without saving the cache.
3. **AI Search Enhancement Failed**: Logs an error message and falls back to the traditional `filterInventory` function.

In all cases, the script gracefully handles the errors and ensures that the application continues to function, even if the AI-enhanced search is not available.

## Integration (2)

This script is designed to integrate with the existing "StackTrackr" search system. It enhances the `filterInventory` function by adding AI-powered search capabilities, without requiring significant changes to the existing codebase.

The script exposes two global variables for integration:

- `window.AISearchEngine`: The `AISearchEngine` class, which can be used directly if needed.
- `window.enhanceExistingSearch`: The `enhanceExistingSearch` function, which should be called to trigger the AI-enhanced search.

To integrate this script, you need to:

1. Ensure that the necessary global variables (`window.aiSearchEnabled`, `window.aiApiKey`, `window.filterInventory`, `window.searchQuery`, and `window.inventory`) are set correctly.
2. Call the `enhanceExistingSearch` function whenever the user performs a search.
3. Ensure that the HTML structure (search input and AI insights panel) is in place.

## Development Notes (2)

1. **Caching**: The script uses localStorage to persist the search result cache. This helps improve performance by reducing the number of requests to the AI search API. However, the cache is limited in size and has a configurable time-to-live (TTL) to prevent the cache from growing indefinitely.

1. **Error Handling**: The script carefully handles errors, both in the cache management and the AI search enhancement process. This ensures that the application can gracefully fall back to the traditional search functionality if the AI-enhanced search is not available for any reason.

1. **UI Integration**: The script integrates with the existing user interface by creating an "AI Insights" panel and updating its content with the AI-generated insights and suggestions. This allows users to interact with the AI-powered features without disrupting the existing search experience.

1. **Scalability**: The `AISearchEngine` class is designed to be reusable and scalable. It can be easily extended or integrated into other parts of the application if needed.

1. **Flexibility**: The configuration options allow you to adjust the cache behavior to suit the specific requirements of the application. This makes the script more adaptable to different use cases and environments.

Overall, this script provides a solid foundation for integrating AI-powered search capabilities into the existing StackTrackr application, with a focus on robustness, performance, and user experience.
