# Pagination.js Documentation

## Purpose & Overview

The `pagination.js` script provides a set of functions to implement pagination functionality in a web application. Pagination is a common technique used to divide large datasets into smaller, more manageable pages, allowing users to navigate through the data more efficiently.

This script is designed to work in conjunction with a table or list of items that needs to be displayed in a paginated format. It calculates the total number of pages based on the available data, renders the pagination controls, and handles navigation between pages.

## Technical Architecture

The `pagination.js` script consists of the following key components:

1. **`calculateTotalPages(data)`**: This function calculates the total number of pages based on the provided data and the `itemsPerPage` constant.
2. **`renderPagination(filteredData)`**: This function is responsible for rendering the pagination controls, including the page number buttons and the "Previous", "Next", "First", and "Last" buttons.
3. **`goToPage(page)`**: This function is called when a user clicks on a page number button or the "Previous" or "Next" buttons. It updates the `currentPage` variable and re-renders the table or list of items.

The script also relies on several external variables and functions, such as `inventory`, `filterInventory()`, `renderTable()`, `searchQuery`, and `elements` (which likely contains references to DOM elements used for the pagination controls).

## Dependencies

The `pagination.js` script does not have any external dependencies. It is designed to work as a standalone module within a larger application.

## Key Functions/Classes

### `calculateTotalPages(data = inventory)`

- **Purpose**: Calculates the total number of pages based on the provided data and the `itemsPerPage` constant.
- **Parameters**:
  - `data` (optional, default: `inventory`): The data to be paginated.
- **Return Value**: The total number of pages.

### `renderPagination(filteredData = filterInventory())`

- **Purpose**: Renders the pagination controls, including the page number buttons and the "Previous", "Next", "First", and "Last" buttons.
- **Parameters**:
  - `filteredData` (optional, default: `filterInventory()`): The filtered data to be paginated.
- **Return Value**: None.

### `goToPage(page)`

- **Purpose**: Navigates to the specified page number, updates the `currentPage` variable, and re-renders the table or list of items.
- **Parameters**:
  - `page`: The page number to navigate to.
- **Return Value**: None.

## Usage Examples

To use the pagination functionality provided by this script, you'll need to integrate it into your application's code. Here's an example of how you might use it:

```javascript
// Initialize pagination
renderPagination();

// Handle page navigation
const firstPageBtn = document.getElementById('first-page');
const prevPageBtn = document.getElementById('prev-page');
const nextPageBtn = document.getElementById('next-page');
const lastPageBtn = document.getElementById('last-page');

firstPageBtn.addEventListener('click', () => goToPage(1));
prevPageBtn.addEventListener('click', () => goToPage(currentPage - 1));
nextPageBtn.addEventListener('click', () => goToPage(currentPage + 1));
lastPageBtn.addEventListener('click', () => goToPage(calculateTotalPages()));
```

In this example, we first call the `renderPagination()` function to render the initial pagination controls. Then, we add event listeners to the "First", "Previous", "Next", and "Last" buttons, which call the `goToPage()` function with the appropriate page number.

## Configuration

The `pagination.js` script relies on the following configuration variables:

- `itemsPerPage`: The number of items to be displayed per page.
- `inventory`: The full dataset to be paginated.
- `filterInventory()`: A function that filters the inventory data (e.g., based on search queries).
- `renderTable()`: A function that re-renders the table or list of items based on the current page.
- `elements`: An object containing references to the DOM elements used for the pagination controls (e.g., page number buttons, "Previous", "Next", "First", "Last" buttons, search results info).

These variables and functions should be defined and configured in your application's code, separate from the `pagination.js` script.

## Error Handling

The `pagination.js` script does not include any explicit error handling. However, it does perform some basic input validation, such as ensuring that the `page` parameter passed to the `goToPage()` function is within the valid range of page numbers.

If any issues arise with the data or the configuration variables, the script may not function as expected. It's recommended to add proper error handling and logging to the script, as well as the surrounding application code, to ensure robust error management.

## Integration

The `pagination.js` script is designed to be integrated into a larger web application that needs to display data in a paginated format. It should be used in conjunction with the following components:

1. **Data Source**: The script relies on a data source (e.g., `inventory`) that can be filtered and paginated.
2. **Filtering/Sorting**: The script assumes the existence of a `filterInventory()` function that can filter and/or sort the data based on user input.
3. **Table/List Rendering**: The script expects a `renderTable()` function that can re-render the table or list of items based on the current page.
4. **Pagination Controls**: The script requires the presence of DOM elements (defined in the `elements` object) to render the pagination controls.

By integrating the `pagination.js` script with these components, you can create a comprehensive and user-friendly pagination system for your web application.

## Development Notes

- The script uses the `Math.max()` and `Math.min()` functions to ensure that the `currentPage` variable is always within the valid range of page numbers.
- The script limits the number of visible page number buttons to a maximum of 7, centered around the current page. This helps prevent the pagination controls from becoming too cluttered on the page.
- The script updates the disabled state of the "Previous", "Next", "First", and "Last" buttons based on the current page number, to provide a better user experience.
- The script updates the search results information element based on the filtered data and the search query, to give users feedback on the current state of the pagination.

Overall, the `pagination.js` script provides a robust and flexible pagination solution that can be easily integrated into a variety of web applications.
