# rSynk Integration for StackTrackr

## Purpose & Overview

This script integrates the rSynk client-side functionality into the StackTrackr application. rSynk is a service that provides LLM-powered search enhancement, allowing StackTrackr to offer more intelligent and contextual search results. The script includes fallback mechanisms to ensure reliable search functionality, even if the rSynk service is unavailable.

## Technical Architecture

The `rSynkClient` class is the main component of this integration. It handles the communication with the rSynk server, caching of results, and fallback to local AI or traditional search. The key components and data flow are as follows:

1. The `rSynkClient` constructor initializes the configuration and tests the connection to the rSynk server.
2. The `enhanceSearch` method is the main entry point, which checks the availability of rSynk, applies rate limiting, and checks the cache before making a request to the rSynk server.
3. The `processrSynkResponse` method takes the raw rSynk response and integrates it with StackTrackr's existing search functionality, applying AI suggestions and merging the results.
4. The `fallbackToLocalAI` and `fallbackToTraditional` methods are used when the rSynk service is unavailable, providing a graceful degradation of the search experience.

## Dependencies

This script relies on the following external dependencies:

- StackTrackr core functionality (not provided in the code snippet)
- `window.aiSearchEngine` (a local AI search enhancement component, if configured)

## Key Functions/Classes

### `rSynkClient` Class

## Constructor

- `constructor(config: Object)`: Initializes the rSynk client with the provided configuration.

## Methods

- `testConnection(): Promise<boolean>`: Tests the connection to the rSynk server and updates the availability status.
- `enhanceSearch(query: string, inventory: Array): Promise<Object>`: Performs an enhanced search using the rSynk service, with fallback mechanisms.
- `processrSynkResponse(rsynkResult: Object, originalQuery: string, inventory: Array): Object`: Processes the rSynk server response and integrates it with StackTrackr's search results.
- `applyAISuggestions(rsynkResult: Object, inventory: Array): Array`: Applies the AI suggestions from the rSynk response to the current inventory.
- `fuzzySearch(query: string, inventory: Array): Array`: Implements a fuzzy search algorithm for flexible matching.
- `editDistance(str1: string, str2: string): number`: Calculates the edit distance between two strings.
- `fallbackToLocalAI(query: string, inventory: Array): Promise<Object>`: Fallbacks to the local AI search enhancement component.
- `fallbackToTraditional(query: string, inventory: Array): Object`: Fallbacks to the traditional StackTrackr search functionality.
- `getTraditionalResults(query: string, inventory: Array): Array`: Retrieves the traditional search results using StackTrackr's existing logic (not shown in the code snippet).

## Usage Examples

To use the rSynk integration, you can create an instance of the `rSynkClient` class and call the `enhanceSearch` method:

```javascript
const rsynkClient = new rSynkClient();

const searchQuery = 'gold coins';
const currentInventory = [
  { name: 'American Gold Eagle', metal: 'gold', type: 'coin', ... },
  { name: 'Canadian Maple Leaf', metal: 'gold', type: 'coin', ... },
  // other inventory items
];

const enhancedResults = await rsynkClient.enhanceSearch(searchQuery, currentInventory);
console.log(enhancedResults);
```

The `enhancedResults` object will contain the search results, with information about the source (rSynk, local AI, or traditional), AI enhancements, and additional metadata.

## Configuration

The `RSYNK_CONFIG` object defines the configuration options for the rSynk integration:

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `serverUrl` | The URL of the rSynk server |
| `localUrl` | The URL of the local rSynk server for development/testing |
| `fallbackToLocal` | Whether to use the local AI search enhancement as a fallback |
| `fallbackToTraditional` | Whether to use the traditional StackTrackr search as a final fallback |
| `timeout` | The timeout for rSynk API calls |
| `retryAttempts` | The number of retry attempts for failed requests |
| `cacheResults` | Whether to cache the rSynk search results |
| `enabled` | Whether the rSynk integration is enabled |
| `debugMode` | Whether to log detailed information for debugging |
| `maxRequestsPerMinute` | The maximum number of requests per minute (client-side rate limiting) |
| `requestCooldown` | The cooldown period between requests (client-side rate limiting) |

## Error Handling

The rSynk integration handles errors in the following ways:

1. If the connection to the rSynk server fails, the `testConnection` method sets the `isAvailable` flag to `false` and updates the UI accordingly.
2. When calling the rSynk API, any errors or unsuccessful responses are caught, and the script falls back to the local AI or traditional search functionality.
3. If the local AI fallback also fails, the script falls back to the traditional StackTrackr search.

The script logs relevant error messages to the console, providing developers with information to troubleshoot issues.

## Integration

The rSynk integration is designed to seamlessly fit into the StackTrackr application. It enhances the existing search functionality by providing more intelligent and contextual results. The script can be integrated into the StackTrackr codebase and called whenever a user performs a search.

## Development Notes

- The script includes a client-side rate limiting mechanism to prevent API abuse and ensure a smooth user experience.
- The caching of rSynk search results helps improve performance and reduce the load on the rSynk server.
- The fuzzy search implementation allows for flexible matching, accommodating typos and common abbreviations.
- The fallback mechanisms ensure that the search functionality remains reliable, even if the rSynk service is unavailable.
- The script is designed to be easily configurable, allowing developers to customize the integration based on their specific requirements.

## Usage Examples (2)

To use the `rSynk` integration, you can follow these steps:

1. Ensure the `rsynk-integration.js_chunk_2` script is included in your application.
2. The `rSynk` client will be automatically initialized when the DOM is ready.
3. You can then interact with the `rSynk` integration using the exposed public API methods:

```javascript
// Enable the rSynk integration
window.rSynk.enable();

// Perform a search
const query = 'your search query';
const inventory = window.inventory; // Assuming you have access to the current inventory
const searchResults = await window.rSynk.enhanceSearch(query, inventory);

// Disable the rSynk integration
window.rSynk.disable();

// Retrieve the current status and statistics
const stats = window.rSynk.getStats();
console.log(stats);
```

## Configuration (2)

The `rSynk` integration is configured using the `RSYNK_CONFIG` object, which is expected to be available in the global scope. The configuration options include:

- `enabled`: Determines whether the `rSynk` integration is initially enabled or disabled.
- `localUrl`: The URL to use for the `rSynk` server in a local/development environment.
- `serverUrl`: The URL to use for the `rSynk` server in a production environment.
- `maxRequestsPerMinute`: The maximum number of requests allowed per minute before rate limiting is applied.
- `requestCooldown`: The minimum time (in milliseconds) between requests before a new request is allowed.

## Error Handling (2)

The `rSynk` integration handles errors in the following ways:

1. If the `StackTrackr` search functionality is unavailable, the script falls back to a simple search implementation.
2. If an error occurs during the `rSynk` integration process, a warning message is logged to the console, and the original `StackTrackr` search functionality is used.
3. The `checkRateLimit()` method checks if the user is within the configured rate limit, and if not, it returns `false` to indicate that the request should be blocked.

## Integration (2)

The `rSynk` integration is designed to work seamlessly with existing product search or inventory management systems. By integrating the `rSynk` client, the application can provide enhanced search capabilities, leveraging AI-powered algorithms to surface the most relevant results.

The script specifically integrates with the `StackTrackr` search functionality, replacing the original `filterInventory()` method with a new one that calls the `rSynk` client's `enhanceSearch()` method. This ensures a transparent and seamless integration for the end-user.

## Development Notes (2)

- The script assumes the existence of a global `window.inventory` array, which contains the current inventory items.
- The script relies on the `StackTrackr` search functionality, which is expected to be available in the global scope. If this functionality is not present, the script will use a simple fallback implementation.
- The script generates and stores an anonymous user ID in the browser's local storage to track usage statistics and monitor the `rSynk` integration.
- The script includes rate limiting functionality to ensure the `rSynk` client is not overloaded with requests.
- The script updates the UI status indicator to reflect the availability of the `rSynk` integration.

Overall, this `rsynk-integration.js_chunk_2` script provides a robust and well-designed integration of the `rSynk` client into a larger application, enhancing the product search and inventory management experience for users.
