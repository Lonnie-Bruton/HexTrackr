# Documentation: app-functions.js

## Purpose & Overview

The `app-functions.js` script is responsible for managing the display and reporting of vulnerability scores in a web application. It contains several functions that handle the following tasks:

1. **Displaying the Latest Results**: The `displayLatestResults` function takes the latest scan results and updates the corresponding HTML panels with the vulnerability statistics.
2. **Generating an HTML Report**: The `generateHTMLReport` function generates a comprehensive HTML report, including an executive summary, the latest scan results, and a history of past scans.
3. **Updating Historical Charts**: The `updateHistoryCharts` function updates the historical charts and tables based on the data stored in the browser's local storage.

This script is a critical component of the application, as it provides the user interface for viewing and analyzing vulnerability data.

## Technical Architecture

The `app-functions.js` script is structured around the following key components:

1. **Display Functions**: The `displayLatestResults` function is responsible for updating the HTML panels with the latest vulnerability statistics.
2. **Reporting Functions**: The `generateHTMLReport` function generates a comprehensive HTML report, including the `generateLatestResultsHTML` and `generateHistoryTableHTML` helper functions.
3. **History Handling**: The `updateHistoryCharts` function updates the historical charts and tables, relying on the `createHistoryChart` and `createHistoryTable` helper functions.

The script relies on a set of data structures to represent the vulnerability data, including `data` objects with properties for each severity level (low, medium, high, critical, and total).

## Dependencies

The `app-functions.js` script does not have any direct dependencies on external libraries or frameworks. However, it does rely on the following:

1. **HTML Elements**: The script interacts with various HTML elements, such as `<div>` and `<canvas>` elements, to display the vulnerability data.
2. **Browser APIs**: The script uses the browser's `localStorage` API to store and retrieve historical scan data.
3. **Chart.js Library**: The script includes functions to create line charts using the Chart.js library, which is not included in the provided code.

## Key Functions/Classes

### `displayLatestResults(result)`

**Purpose**: Updates the HTML panels with the latest vulnerability statistics.

**Parameters**:

- `result` (Object): An object containing the latest scan data, including the `data` property with vulnerability statistics.

**Return Value**: None

### `generateHTMLReport(history)`

**Purpose**: Generates a comprehensive HTML report based on the provided history data.

**Parameters**:

- `history` (Array): An array of objects, each representing a past scan and containing the `date`, `filename`, and `data` properties.

**Return Value**: A string containing the HTML report.

### `updateHistoryCharts()`

**Purpose**: Updates the historical charts and tables based on the data stored in the browser's local storage.

**Parameters**: None

**Return Value**: None

## Usage Examples

To use the functions provided in `app-functions.js`, you would typically call them from other parts of your application, such as event handlers or API response callbacks. Here are some example usage scenarios:

1. **Displaying the Latest Results**:

   ```javascript
   const latestScanResult = fetchLatestScanResult();
   displayLatestResults(latestScanResult);
   ```

1. **Generating an HTML Report**:

   ```javascript
   const scanHistory = fetchScanHistory();
   const htmlReport = generateHTMLReport(scanHistory);
   // Do something with the generated HTML report (e.g., display it or save it to a file)
   ```

1. **Updating Historical Charts**:

   ```javascript
   updateHistoryCharts();
   ```

## Configuration

The `app-functions.js` script does not require any specific configuration options or environment variables. It assumes that the necessary HTML elements and data structures are available in the application.

## Error Handling

The script does not explicitly handle errors, but it does include some basic input validation. For example, the `displayLatestResults` and `generateHTMLReport` functions check if the input data is valid before processing it.

## Integration

The `app-functions.js` script is a core component of the vulnerability reporting application. It is responsible for managing the user interface and data presentation, and it is expected to be integrated with other parts of the application, such as:

1. **Data Fetching**: The script relies on data from other parts of the application, such as the latest scan results and historical data.
2. **User Interface**: The script updates the HTML elements to display the vulnerability data, and it may interact with other UI components, such as charts and tables.
3. **Data Storage**: The script uses the browser's `localStorage` API to store and retrieve historical scan data.

## Development Notes

1. **Chart.js Integration**: The script includes functions to create line charts using the Chart.js library, but the library is not included in the provided code. You will need to ensure that the Chart.js library is properly integrated into your application for the charting functionality to work.

1. **Styling**: The script includes some basic HTML and CSS styling to format the report. However, you may want to further customize the styling to match the branding and design of your application.

1. **Extensibility**: The script is designed to be extensible, with the ability to add new severity levels or modify the data structures as needed. However, any changes to the data structures or reporting logic may require updates to the corresponding functions.

1. **Performance**: The script currently generates the entire HTML report in a single function, which may not be optimal for large datasets or frequent updates. You may want to consider implementing a more incremental or on-demand approach to report generation to improve performance.

1. **Error Handling**: While the script includes some basic input validation, it does not have a comprehensive error handling strategy. You may want to add more robust error handling and logging to ensure that the application can gracefully handle unexpected data or user input.
