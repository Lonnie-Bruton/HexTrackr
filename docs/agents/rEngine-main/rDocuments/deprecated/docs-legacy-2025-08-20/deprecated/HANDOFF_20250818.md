# Handoff Document - 2025-08-18

## 1. Session Summary

This session focused on debugging and improving the agent's core operational workflow. Key activities included:

1. **Diagnosing Script Execution Failures:** Identified that running scripts directly in the VS Code terminal triggered macOS security prompts and that Docker-dependent services were failing because the Docker daemon was not running or had crashed.
2. **Resolving Execution Issues:**
    * Created `launch-rEngine-services.sh` to consolidate startup procedures and run them in external terminals, bypassing VS Code's environment.
    * Identified and resolved a system-wide memory issue caused by multiple `ollama` instances, which was crashing the Docker daemon.
1. **Correcting Memory Protocol:** After repeated failures to save to memory, a fundamental misunderstanding of the architecture was corrected. The system uses a dual MCP server architecture.
2. **Protocol Documentation:** Initiated a comprehensive review of the project's protocols and created `PROTOCOL_STACK_REVIEW_20250818.md` to document findings and propose a more organized structure.

## 2. Code Changes and Artifacts

* **`rEngine/mcp-client.js` (Created):** A Node.js module using `node-fetch` to send memory entries to the Memory MCP Server (`mcp-server-1` on port 3036).
* **`rEngine/add-context.js` (Refactored):** Modified to use `mcp-client.js`, shifting from direct file I/O to a network-based API call for adding memory.
* **`launch-rEngine-services.sh` (Created):** A master script to start the Docker environment and other required services in external terminals.
* **`PROTOCOL_STACK_REVIEW_20250818.md` (Created):** A document analyzing the current state of project protocols and proposing a migration to a centralized `protocols/` directory.

## 3. Key Learnings & Corrected Understanding

My operational protocol has been updated with the following critical corrections:

* **Primary Point of Failure:** The `ECONNREFUSED` errors were caused by the Docker Desktop application not running, which prevented the `mcp-server` container from being available on `localhost:3036`.
* **Dual MCP Architecture:** The project utilizes two distinct servers for agent operations:
  * **Memory MCP Server (`mcp-server-1` @ port 3036):** This is the sole endpoint for **storing and retrieving data**. All memory operations must be `fetch`/`axios` requests to this service.
  * **rEngine MCP Server (`rengine-platfc` @ port 3034):** This is the endpoint for **executing commands and scripts**. Future requests to run tools or scripts within the rEngine should be sent to this service via its specific remote command protocol, which still needs to be fully investigated.
* **Operational Flow:** The correct procedure is to **never run `node` scripts directly from the terminal for core operations**. Instead, I must send a command to the `rengine-platfc` service to execute the script on my behalf.

## 4. Next Steps

1. **Verify Docker & Restart Services:** Ensure Docker Desktop is running and stable, then execute `./launch-rEngine-services.sh` to bring all services online.
2. **Confirm Memory Write:** Retry the `add-context.js` script to confirm a successful memory write to the now-available `mcp-server` on port 3036.
3. **Investigate rEngine Protocol:** Analyze the `rengine-platform` service to determine the correct protocol for sending remote commands to execute scripts.
4. **Implement Protocol Refactoring:** Proceed with the action plan outlined in `PROTOCOL_STACK_REVIEW_20250818.md`, starting with the creation of the `protocols/` directory.
5. **Adhere to New Protocol:** All subsequent actions must strictly follow the dual-server architecture for memory and command execution.
