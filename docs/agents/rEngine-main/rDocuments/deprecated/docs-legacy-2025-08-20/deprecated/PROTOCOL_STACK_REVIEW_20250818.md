# Protocol Stack Review - 2025-08-18

## 1. Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive review of the existing protocol stack for the StackTrackr project. The current system, while functional, has grown organically, leading to documentation being scattered across the repository. This review identifies key protocols and proposes a new, modular structure to improve clarity, maintainability, and developer onboarding.

The core recommendation is to create a centralized `protocols/` directory at the root of the repository to house all official protocol documentation.

## 2. Current Protocol Analysis

The following key protocols and operational guides were identified during the review:

* **Agent Initialization & Memory:** `COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`, `BRAIN_SHARE_MEMORY_SYSTEM.md`
* **Development Environment:** `DOCKER_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md`, `MOBILE_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`
* **AI & Agent Workflow:** `AGENT_WORKFLOW_MAP.md`, `RENGINE.md`, `VISION.md`
* **Documentation & Reporting:** `AGENT_DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md`, `RSCRIBE_DOCUMENT_PROTOCOL.md`
* **Git & Versioning:** Implicitly defined through scripts like `git-checkpoint.sh`.

## Issues

* **Scattered Documentation:** Protocols are located in `docs/`, the root directory, and within `rEngine/`. This makes it difficult to get a holistic view of project standards.
* **Implicit Protocols:** Critical workflows, like Git checkpointing, are embedded in scripts without a corresponding high-level document explaining the *why*.
* **Naming Inconsistencies:** Similar concepts are sometimes described in different terms across various files.

## 3. Proposed New Structure: The `protocols/` Directory

To address these issues, I propose creating a new top-level directory named `protocols/`. This directory will become the single source of truth for all project protocols.

### Proposed Directory Migration

* **`protocols/00_START_HERE.md`**: A new file that acts as an index and guide to the protocol system.
* **`protocols/01_environment_setup.md`**: Consolidating `DOCKER_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md` and `MOBILE_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`.
* **`protocols/02_agent_initialization.md`**: Based on `COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`.
* **`protocols/03_memory_management.md`**: Detailing the MCP server interaction, based on `BRAIN_SHARE_MEMORY_SYSTEM.md` and our recent discoveries.
* **`protocols/04_git_workflow.md`**: A new file explicitly documenting the branching, commit, and checkpointing strategy.
* **`protocols/05_ai_architecture.md`**: Merging the concepts from `RENGINE.md`, `VISION.md`, and `AGENT_WORKFLOW_MAP.md`.
* **`protocols/06_documentation_standards.md`**: Combining `AGENT_DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md` and `RSCRIBE_DOCUMENT_PROTOCOL.md`.

### Benefits of the New Structure

* **Centralization:** All protocols in one place.
* **Clarity:** A numbered, logical flow from environment setup to daily workflow.
* **Maintainability:** Easier to update and manage documentation.
* **Discoverability:** New team members can be directed to a single folder.

## 4. Action Plan

1. Create the `protocols/` directory.
2. Create the new markdown files with the consolidated and updated information.
3. Archive the old documentation files to avoid confusion.
4. Update `COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` to point to the new `protocols/` directory as the primary source of truth.

This refactoring will establish a robust and scalable foundation for future development.
