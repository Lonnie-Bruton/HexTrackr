# 📚 Documentation Review & Archive Report

*Completed August 18, 2025*

## 🎯 **Review Summary**

Conducted comprehensive review of core documentation files to identify outdated information, conflicts with current implementation, and strategic documents that needed archiving. Updated key files to reflect the actual state of rEngine Platform v2.1.0.

---

## 📋 **Documents Reviewed**

### **✅ UPDATED TO CURRENT REALITY**

#### **1. `/docs/RENGINE.md` - MAJOR REVISION COMPLETED**

## Previous Issues:

- ❌ Claimed Gemini as "Primary Intelligence" (actually Groq is primary)
- ❌ Referenced non-existent production URLs (`https://api.rengine.dev/relay`)
- ❌ Wrong port information (claimed `localhost:8080`, actually `localhost:3034`)
- ❌ Missing Docker infrastructure, mobile development, current AI architecture
- ❌ Obsolete directory structure and outdated service tiers

## ✅ Updated Content:

- **Current AI Architecture**: 5-tier system (Groq → Claude → OpenAI → Gemini → Ollama)
- **Correct Port Information**: Docker services on ports 3032-3038
- **Container Architecture**: Complete Docker infrastructure documentation
- **Mobile Development**: Integration with portable development system
- **Memory Persistence**: MCP-based cross-session knowledge system
- **Performance Metrics**: Real performance data from August 2025 implementation
- **Development Workflow**: Actual commands and procedures that work today

#### **2. `/VISION.md` - UPDATED TO REFLECT REALITY**

## Previous Issues: (2)

- ❌ Future-focused without acknowledging current achievements
- ❌ Outdated economic models and port information
- ❌ Missing mobile development and Docker capabilities

## ✅ Updated Content: (2)

- **Current State Recognition**: Clearly distinguishes achieved vs planned features
- **Realistic Roadmap**: Based on actual v2.1.0 foundation
- **Proven Performance**: Real metrics from current implementation
- **Strategic Advantages**: Both realized and planned competitive moats
- **Success Metrics**: Validation of current achievements

### **📄 ARCHIVED (OUTDATED/STRATEGIC)**

#### **1. `/docs/gemini-price-api-strategy.md`** → `archive/outdated-docs-2025-08-18/`

**Reason**: Future vision document for Gemini market intelligence integration

- Strategic planning document, not current implementation
- Contains valuable ideas for Q4 2025 market intelligence phase
- Conflicted with current Groq-primary AI architecture

#### **2. `/docs/API-STRATEGY.md`** → `archive/outdated-docs-2025-08-18/`

**Reason**: Strategic document that doesn't reflect current Docker-based development

- Future-facing competitive positioning
- Doesn't document current mobile development or container systems
- Strategic guidance for platform expansion (preserved for future reference)

### **✅ VALIDATED AS CURRENT**

#### **1. `/docs/table-architecture.md` - NO CHANGES NEEDED**

**Status**: Accurately describes current StackTrackr table system

- Documentation matches current implementation
- Still relevant and accurate
- No conflicts or outdated information

#### **2. `/docs/openwebui-api-reference.md` - VALUABLE REFERENCE**

**Status**: Comprehensive Open WebUI documentation, kept as reference

- Contains valuable information for future integrations
- Not conflicting with current system
- Useful for planning Open WebUI pipeline additions
