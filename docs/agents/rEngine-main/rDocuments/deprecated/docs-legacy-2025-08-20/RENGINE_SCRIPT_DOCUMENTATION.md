## Integration Notes

All scripts are designed to work together as a cohesive system. The typical workflow is:

1. **Startup**: `one-click-startup.js` or `universal-agent-init.js`
2. **Monitoring**: `scribe-console.js` for real-time visibility
3. **Maintenance**: Automatic via Smart Scribe and keep-alive scripts
4. **Testing**: Regular health checks and component tests

The system is designed for hands-off operation once properly configured, with comprehensive logging and automatic recovery capabilities.
