# Context Lifecycle Manager Documentation

## Purpose & Overview

The `context-lifecycle.js` script implements a `ContextLifecycleManager` class that is responsible for managing the lifecycle of application contexts. This includes managing configuration, performing automated cleanup of expired contexts, and providing recommendations for maintaining the system.

The primary goals of this script are to:

1. Ensure that application contexts are properly managed and cleaned up to prevent resource leaks or other issues.
2. Provide a centralized and configurable mechanism for controlling the lifecycle of contexts.
3. Offer recommendations and guidance to developers on best practices for managing application contexts.

## Technical Architecture

The `ContextLifecycleManager` class is the core component of this script. It has the following key responsibilities:

1. **Configuration Management**: The class reads and writes a configuration file (`lifecycle-config.json`) that stores settings such as the retention period, "forever mode", and auto-cleanup options.
2. **Cleanup Execution**: The `performCleanup()` method checks the current configuration and performs the necessary cleanup actions, such as archiving expired contexts.
3. **Logging**: The class maintains a log file (`cleanup-log.json`) to record the results of each cleanup operation.

The script also includes a self-execution block that creates an instance of the `ContextLifecycleManager` and initializes it.

## Dependencies

This script relies on the following external dependencies:

- `fs.promises`: The Node.js built-in file system module, used for reading and writing configuration and log files.
- `path`: The Node.js built-in path module, used for constructing file paths.

## Key Functions/Classes

### `ContextLifecycleManager` Class

The `ContextLifecycleManager` class is the main component of this script.

#### Constructor

- **Parameters**: None
- **Returns**: A new instance of the `ContextLifecycleManager` class.

The constructor initializes the file paths for the configuration, flagged items, and cleanup log files.

#### `initialize()`

- **Parameters**: None
- **Returns**: A Promise that resolves when the initialization is complete.

The `initialize()` method sets up the initial configuration file if it doesn't already exist. It also logs a message to indicate that the `ContextLifecycleManager` has been initialized.

#### `getConfig()`

- **Parameters**: None
- **Returns**: A Promise that resolves to the current configuration object.

The `getConfig()` method reads the configuration file and returns the current settings. If the configuration file doesn't exist, it returns a default configuration.

#### `performCleanup()`

- **Parameters**: None
- **Returns**: A Promise that resolves to an object with information about the cleanup operation.

The `performCleanup()` method is responsible for executing the context cleanup process. It first retrieves the current configuration and then checks if the "forever mode" is enabled. If so, it skips the cleanup and returns a result indicating that forever mode is enabled. Otherwise, it performs the cleanup and returns a result with the number of archived contexts and a recommendation to enable forever mode.

## Usage Examples

To use the `ContextLifecycleManager`, you can create an instance of the class and call the `initialize()` and `performCleanup()` methods:

```javascript
const ContextLifecycleManager = require('./context-lifecycle');

const manager = new ContextLifecycleManager();
manager.initialize()
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Context Lifecycle Manager ready');
    return manager.performCleanup();
  })
  .then((result) => {
    console.log(result);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  });
```

## Configuration

The `ContextLifecycleManager` class reads and writes a configuration file located at `lifecycle-config.json`. The configuration file contains the following settings:

| Setting | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `retentionDays` | Number | The number of days to retain application contexts before they are eligible for cleanup. |
| `foreverMode` | Boolean | When enabled, the cleanup process is skipped, and all contexts are retained indefinitely. |
| `autoCleanup` | Boolean | When enabled, the cleanup process is automatically triggered at regular intervals. |
| `lastCleanup` | Date (string) | The timestamp of the last successful cleanup operation. |

If the configuration file doesn't exist, the `ContextLifecycleManager` will create it with default values.

## Error Handling

The `ContextLifecycleManager` class handles the following potential errors:

1. **Configuration File Access Error**: If the configuration file cannot be accessed or read, the class will use a default configuration.
2. **Cleanup Execution Error**: If any errors occur during the cleanup process, the `performCleanup()` method will return an object with information about the error.

## Integration

The `ContextLifecycleManager` class is designed to be integrated into a larger application or system that manages application contexts. It provides a centralized and configurable mechanism for controlling the lifecycle of these contexts, ensuring that they are properly managed and cleaned up as needed.

To integrate the `ContextLifecycleManager` into your application, you can create an instance of the class and call the `initialize()` and `performCleanup()` methods at appropriate points in your application's lifecycle. For example, you might call `performCleanup()` as part of a scheduled task or event to ensure that the context cleanup process is executed regularly.

## Development Notes

- The script uses the `fs.promises` module to handle file system operations, which provides a more modern and promise-based API compared to the traditional `fs` module.
- The configuration file is stored in the same directory as the script, which may not be the best location for production deployments. Consider allowing the configuration file path to be configurable or using a more appropriate location.
- The script does not currently handle any errors that may occur during the cleanup process. It's recommended to add more robust error handling and logging to ensure that any issues are properly surfaced and addressed.
- The "forever mode" feature is a useful option, but it's important to ensure that it is only enabled when appropriate, as it can lead to resource leaks or other issues if left on indefinitely.
- The script could be extended to provide more advanced features, such as the ability to flag specific contexts as "never expire", or to integrate with external monitoring or alerting systems.
