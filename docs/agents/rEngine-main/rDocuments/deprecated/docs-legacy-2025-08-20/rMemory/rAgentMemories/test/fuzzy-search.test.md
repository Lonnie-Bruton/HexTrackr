# Fuzzy Search Test Suite

## Purpose & Overview

This script tests the functionality of the `fuzzySearch` function, which is part of the `fuzzy-search.js` module. The `fuzzySearch` function is designed to perform a fuzzy search operation, allowing users to find relevant items in a list of targets even when the input query does not exactly match the target text.

The purpose of this test suite is to ensure that the `fuzzySearch` function behaves as expected, correctly identifying relevant targets based on a provided query string while excluding irrelevant results.

## Technical Architecture

The `fuzzy-search.test.js` script is a test suite that utilizes the built-in `assert` module from Node.js to validate the behavior of the `fuzzySearch` function. The script imports the `fuzzySearch` function from the `../js/fuzzy-search.js` module.

The test suite performs the following steps:

1. Defines a set of target strings to be searched, in this case, `['American Gold Eagle', 'American Silver Eagle']`.
2. Calls the `fuzzySearch` function with the query string `'Silver Eagle'` and the target array.
3. Extracts the `text` property from the resulting search objects and stores them in the `texts` array.
4. Asserts that the `'American Gold Eagle'` text is not included in the `texts` array, as it should not be a relevant result for the `'Silver Eagle'` query.
5. Asserts that the `'American Silver Eagle'` text is included in the `texts` array, as it should be a relevant result for the `'Silver Eagle'` query.
6. Logs a success message to the console.

## Dependencies

This test suite depends on the following external modules:

- `assert`: The built-in Node.js module for making assertions and validating test cases.
- `../js/fuzzy-search.js`: The module containing the `fuzzySearch` function being tested.

## Key Functions/Classes

### `fuzzySearch(query, targets)`

- **Parameters**:
  - `query` (string): The search query to be used for the fuzzy search.
  - `targets` (array): An array of strings representing the target items to be searched.
- **Return Value**:
  - An array of search result objects, where each object has a `text` property containing the matched target string.

## Usage Examples

```javascript
const { fuzzySearch } = require('../js/fuzzy-search.js');

const targets = ['American Gold Eagle', 'American Silver Eagle', 'Canadian Maple Leaf'];
const results = fuzzySearch('Silver Eagle', targets);

console.log(results);
// Output:
// [
//   { text: 'American Silver Eagle' },
//   { text: 'Canadian Maple Leaf' }
// ]
```

In this example, the `fuzzySearch` function is called with the query `'Silver Eagle'` and the target array `['American Gold Eagle', 'American Silver Eagle', 'Canadian Maple Leaf']`. The function returns an array of search result objects, where each object has a `text` property containing the matched target string.

## Configuration

This test suite does not require any specific configuration or environment variables.

## Error Handling

The `fuzzySearch` function is expected to handle any errors that may occur during the search process. If an error occurs, the function should return an empty array or throw an appropriate error.

## Integration

The `fuzzy-search.test.js` script is part of the testing suite for the `fuzzy-search.js` module, which is likely used in a larger application or system. The results of this test suite should help ensure the reliability and correctness of the `fuzzySearch` function, which is an important component of the overall system.

## Development Notes

No specific implementation details or gotchas have been provided in the given information. The test suite appears to be a straightforward validation of the `fuzzySearch` function's behavior.
