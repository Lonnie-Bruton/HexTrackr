# MCP Server Documentation

## Purpose & Overview

This script sets up a simple Express.js web server that serves two basic routes: a `/health` endpoint that returns a 200 OK status, and a root `/` endpoint that returns a "MCP Server is running!" message. This server can be used as a foundational piece for building more complex web applications or microservices.

## Technical Architecture

The code imports the `express` library, creates an Express application instance, and then defines two route handlers:

1. The `/health` route, which responds with a 200 OK status when hit. This is a common health check endpoint for monitoring the availability of a service.
2. The root `/` route, which simply returns a "MCP Server is running!" message.

Finally, the server is configured to listen on port 8082 and log a message when it starts running.

## Dependencies

This script has the following external dependencies:

| Dependency | Version | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `express` | ^4.17.1 | Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js |

## Key Functions/Classes

### `app.get('/health', (req, res) => { ... })`

- **Parameters**:
  - `req` (Express.Request): The incoming HTTP request object.
  - `res` (Express.Response): The outgoing HTTP response object.
- **Return Value**: None. The function sends a 200 OK response directly.
- **Description**: Handles requests to the `/health` endpoint, responding with a 200 OK status to indicate that the server is running and healthy.

### `app.get('/', (req, res) => { ... })`

- **Parameters**:
  - `req` (Express.Request): The incoming HTTP request object.
  - `res` (Express.Response): The outgoing HTTP response object.
- **Return Value**: None. The function sends a response message directly.
- **Description**: Handles requests to the root `/` endpoint, responding with a "MCP Server is running!" message.

### `app.listen(port, () => { ... })`

- **Parameters**:
  - `port` (number): The port number to listen on.
- **Return Value**: None. The function starts the server and listens for incoming requests.
- **Description**: Configures the Express.js app to listen for incoming HTTP requests on the specified port (8082 in this case) and logs a message when the server starts running.

## Usage Examples

To use this MCP Server, you can start the server by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node index.js
```

This will start the server and make it available at `http://localhost:8082`. You can then test the two available routes:

1. Health Check: `curl http://localhost:8082/health`
   - Expected Response: `OK`
1. Root Route: `curl http://localhost:8082/`
   - Expected Response: `MCP Server is running!`

## Configuration

This MCP Server has a single configuration option:

- `port` (number): The port number to listen on. In this example, the port is set to `8082`, but you can change it to any available port on your system.

## Error Handling

This simple MCP Server does not have any complex error handling mechanisms. If there are any issues with the Express.js server, such as a failed port binding, the server will log the error to the console.

## Integration

The MCP Server can be integrated into a larger system as a foundational piece for building more complex web applications or microservices. It provides a basic structure for handling HTTP requests and can be extended with additional routes, middleware, and functionality as needed.

## Development Notes

This MCP Server is a minimal example and does not include any advanced features or error handling. In a production environment, you would likely want to add the following improvements:

- Implement more robust error handling and logging
- Add middleware for parsing request bodies, handling CORS, etc.
- Integrate with a monitoring or health checking system
- Deploy the server using a containerization tool like Docker
- Configure the server to run as a daemon or service

Overall, this MCP Server provides a simple starting point for building more complex web applications or microservices using Node.js and Express.js.
