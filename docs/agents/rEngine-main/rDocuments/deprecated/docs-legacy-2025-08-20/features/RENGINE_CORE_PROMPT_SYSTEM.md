## 🔧 **Protocol Integration**

### **Rapid Context Recall Protocol**

- **Target:** <10 seconds context retrieval
- **Method:** Parallel file access to primary context sources
- **Triggers:** User requests for extended context or recent work
- **Fallbacks:** Emergency reconstruction methods

### **Recall Prime Directive Protocol**  

- **Target:** <30 seconds full restoration
- **Method:** Emergency sequence for complete context recovery
- **Triggers:** Agent appears to have lost platform knowledge
- **Validation:** Checklist confirmation of restored capabilities

---

## 🎯 **Usage Guidelines**

### **For Users:**

## Starting New Session:

```

1. Drag `rPrompts/bootstrap-intelligence.prompt.md` into chat
2. Send the file
3. Agent instantly ready with full capabilities

```

## Agent Loses Context:

```

1. Drag `rPrompts/emergency-recall.prompt.md` into chat  
2. Agent executes emergency restoration
3. Full intelligence restored in <30 seconds

```

## Specialized Work:

```

1. Drag appropriate focus prompt (development-focus.prompt.md or analysis-focus.prompt.md)
2. Agent optimizes for specific task type
3. Enhanced capabilities for specialized work

```

### **For AI Agents:**

## Bootstrap Activation:

- Execute file reads in parallel
- Confirm platform recognition
- Load current status and capabilities
- Respond with readiness confirmation

## Context Recovery:

- Execute emergency restoration sequence
- Validate restored knowledge with checklist
- Confirm operational status
- Resume normal operations
