# `start-all-services.sh` - rEngine Core Ecosystem Startup Script

## Purpose & Overview

The `start-all-services.sh` script is a critical component in the rEngine Core ecosystem. It is responsible for launching and managing the various services and dependencies required for the StackTrackr Memory System to function properly. This script ensures that all necessary components are running and performing health checks to verify their operational status.

## Key Functions/Classes

The script performs the following key functions:

1. **Memory Scribe Service Startup**: Starts the Memory Scribe service, which is responsible for managing and persisting the memory data for the StackTrackr system.
2. **Ollama/rEngine Service Startup**: Checks if the Ollama (rEngine) service is running, and starts it if not. Ollama is the core "Intelligent Development Wrapper" platform that powers the rEngine Core ecosystem.
3. **Health Checks**: Performs health checks on the Memory Scribe and Ollama/rEngine services to ensure they are operational and responsive.
4. **Agent Status Display**: Provides information about the current agent (GitHub Copilot) and the status of the memory system.

## Dependencies

The `start-all-services.sh` script relies on the following dependencies:

- **Node.js**: The Memory Scribe service is a Node.js application, so Node.js must be installed on the system.
- **Ollama/rEngine**: The script interacts with the Ollama/rEngine service, which is the core platform for the rEngine Core ecosystem.
- **Memory Scribe**: The script starts and manages the Memory Scribe service, which is a critical component for the StackTrackr Memory System.

## Usage Examples

To use the `start-all-services.sh` script, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the script has execute permissions:

   ```bash
   chmod +x start-all-services.sh
   ```

1. Run the script:

   ```bash
   ./start-all-services.sh
   ```

The script will output the status of the various services and perform the necessary startup and health check operations.

## Configuration

The `start-all-services.sh` script does not require any specific configuration. It assumes that the necessary dependencies (Node.js, Ollama/rEngine, Memory Scribe) are properly installed and configured on the system.

## Integration Points

The `start-all-services.sh` script is a key integration point within the rEngine Core ecosystem. It ensures that the StackTrackr Memory System, which is a critical component, is properly initialized and functioning. Other rEngine Core components and services rely on the successful execution of this script to ensure the overall system is operational.

## Troubleshooting

If issues arise during the execution of the `start-all-services.sh` script, you can try the following troubleshooting steps:

1. **Check Service Logs**: Examine the logs for the Memory Scribe and Ollama/rEngine services to identify any error messages or clues about the issue.
2. **Verify Dependencies**: Ensure that the required dependencies (Node.js, Ollama/rEngine) are properly installed and configured on the system.
3. **Check File Permissions**: Ensure that the `start-all-services.sh` script has the necessary execute permissions.
4. **Inspect Environment Variables**: Verify that any required environment variables are set correctly.
5. **Test Individual Components**: Try starting the Memory Scribe and Ollama/rEngine services individually to isolate the issue.

If you are unable to resolve the issue, you may need to seek further assistance from the rEngine Core development team.
