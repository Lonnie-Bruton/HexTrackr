# Project Audit Script

## Purpose & Overview

The `project-audit.sh` script is a critical component of the rEngine Core platform. It provides a comprehensive audit of a user's project, analyzing various aspects of the project structure, dependencies, and configuration. This script is designed to help developers and DevOps engineers ensure the integrity and reliability of their rEngine-based applications.

## Key Functions/Classes

The `project-audit.sh` script performs the following key functions:

1. **Project Structure Validation**: The script checks the project directory structure, ensuring that it conforms to the expected rEngine Core conventions and best practices.
2. **Dependency Analysis**: It examines the project's dependencies, including external libraries and frameworks, and verifies their compatibility with the rEngine Core ecosystem.
3. **Configuration Validation**: The script validates the project's configuration files, ensuring that they are properly formatted and contain the necessary settings for the rEngine Core platform.
4. **Artifact Verification**: It checks the integrity of the project's build artifacts, such as compiled binaries and packaged distributions, to ensure they are correctly generated and can be deployed.
5. **Integration Checks**: The script performs a series of integration tests, simulating the deployment and execution of the project within the rEngine Core environment.

## Dependencies

The `project-audit.sh` script depends on the following components and tools:

- rEngine Core SDK
- Project directory structure and configuration files
- External dependencies specified in the project's manifest
- Deployment and runtime environment provided by the rEngine Core platform

## Usage Examples

To use the `project-audit.sh` script, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the root directory of your rEngine-based project.
2. Run the script using the following command:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/project-audit.sh
   ```

1. The script will automatically perform the project audit and display the results in the console.

Example output:

```
[✓] Project structure validated
[✓] Dependencies checked and verified
[✓] Configuration files validated
[✓] Build artifacts verified
[✓] Integration tests passed

Project audit completed successfully!
```

## Configuration

The `project-audit.sh` script does not require any specific configuration settings. However, it relies on the project's directory structure and configuration files to be properly set up according to the rEngine Core conventions.

## Integration Points

The `project-audit.sh` script is tightly integrated with the rEngine Core platform and is designed to be used as part of the overall development and deployment workflow. It can be incorporated into the following integration points:

1. **Continuous Integration (CI)**: The script can be added as a step in the CI pipeline to ensure project integrity before building and deploying the application.
2. **Pre-Deployment Checks**: The script can be executed as part of the pre-deployment process to validate the project's readiness for deployment.
3. **Developer Tooling**: The script can be used by developers as a diagnostic tool to identify and resolve issues in their rEngine-based projects.

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues that may arise when using the `project-audit.sh` script and their potential solutions:

1. **Project Structure Validation Failure**:
   - Ensure that the project directory structure follows the rEngine Core conventions.
   - Check for any missing or misplaced files or directories.

1. **Dependency Validation Failure**:
   - Verify that all external dependencies specified in the project's manifest are compatible with the rEngine Core platform.
   - Check for any version conflicts or missing dependencies.

1. **Configuration Validation Failure**:
   - Ensure that the project's configuration files are properly formatted and contain the necessary settings for the rEngine Core platform.
   - Check for any typos or invalid values in the configuration files.

1. **Build Artifact Verification Failure**:
   - Ensure that the project's build process is correctly configured and generates the expected artifacts.
   - Check for any issues with the build toolchain or the rEngine Core SDK.

1. **Integration Test Failure**:
   - Verify that the project's integration with the rEngine Core platform is correctly configured.
   - Check for any environmental or compatibility issues that may be causing the integration tests to fail.

If you encounter any issues that you cannot resolve, please refer to the rEngine Core documentation or contact the rEngine Core support team for further assistance.
