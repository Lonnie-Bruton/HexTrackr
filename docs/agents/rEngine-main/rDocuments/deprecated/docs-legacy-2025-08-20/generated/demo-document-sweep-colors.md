# rEngine Core: Document Sweep Color Demo

## Purpose & Overview

The `demo-document-sweep-colors.js` file is a demonstration script that showcases how the split-scribe console in the rEngine Core platform will display document sweep activities. It simulates a series of document sweep events and logs them to the console, using color-coded formatting to differentiate between various types of activities.

This demo script is intended to provide a visual representation of how the rEngine Core's monitoring and logging capabilities can help developers and operators track and understand the document sweep process, which is a crucial component of the rEngine Core's "Intelligent Development Wrapper" functionality.

## Key Functions/Classes

The main function in this script is `simulateDocumentSweepDisplay()`, which is responsible for:

1. Clearing the console and setting up the initial layout.
2. Defining an array of simulated document sweep activities, each with a timestamp, message, type, and associated color.
3. Iterating through the activities and printing them to the console, using the provided color codes to highlight different types of events.
4. Displaying a summary of the recent activities and a list of available commands.
5. Providing a color legend to explain the meaning of each color used in the console output.

The script also defines several color constants (e.g., `PINK`, `YELLOW`, `ORANGE`, etc.) that are used to apply ANSI escape codes for terminal color formatting.

## Dependencies

This script is designed to be used within the rEngine Core ecosystem and does not have any external dependencies. It primarily interacts with the split-scribe console, which is a core component of the rEngine Core platform.

## Usage Examples

To run the Document Sweep Color Demo, simply execute the script using Node.js:

```bash
node demo-document-sweep-colors.js
```

This will display the simulated document sweep activities in the console, along with the color-coded formatting and the available commands.

## Configuration

This script does not require any specific configuration or environment variables. It is a standalone demo script that can be executed as-is.

## Integration Points

The `demo-document-sweep-colors.js` script is designed to showcase the capabilities of the rEngine Core's split-scribe console, which is a key component for monitoring and logging various activities within the rEngine Core ecosystem. This script demonstrates how the console can be used to provide a clear and visually-appealing representation of document sweep operations, which are an integral part of the rEngine Core's "Intelligent Development Wrapper" functionality.

## Troubleshooting

As this is a demonstration script, there are no specific troubleshooting steps required. If you encounter any issues with the rEngine Core platform or the split-scribe console, please refer to the official rEngine Core documentation or contact the rEngine Core support team for assistance.
