# Agent Hello Workflow - Persistent Memory and Context Continuity

## Purpose & Overview

The `agent-hello-workflow.js` script manages the initialization and context loading process for an intelligent agent. It handles the integration of various memory sources, including the latest handoff, personal memories, MCP (Memory and Cognition Platform) memories, and technical knowledge, to provide a seamless and contextual experience for the agent.

The script's primary objectives are:

1. **Persistent Memory**: Ensure the agent maintains continuity of context and access to its previous interactions, knowledge, and memories.
2. **Intelligent Initialization**: Load and synthesize relevant information from different memory sources to generate a comprehensive continuation prompt for the agent.
3. **Memory Management**: Provide functionality to save personal context, search through memories, and generate detailed context summaries.
4. **Memory System Integration**: Integrate with the Memory Intelligence System, including the `memory-intelligence.js`, `recall.js`, and `add-context.js` modules.

## Technical Architecture

The `AgentHelloWorkflow` class is the main component of this script, responsible for managing the agent's initialization and memory-related operations. The class has the following key components:

1. **Memory Paths**: Defines the file paths for various memory-related resources, such as the `rAgentMemories` directory, `memory-intelligence.js`, `recall.js`, and `add-context.js` modules.
2. **Memory System Status**: Checks the status of the Memory Intelligence System.
3. **Initialization**: The `initializeAgent()` method loads the latest handoff, personal memories, MCP memories, and technical knowledge, and generates a continuation prompt based on the available context.
4. **Memory Handling**: Methods for loading and extracting information from the different memory sources, such as `getLatestHandoff()`, `loadPersonalMemories()`, `loadMCPMemories()`, and `loadKnowledgeDB()`.
5. **Continuation Prompt Generation**: The `generateContinuationPrompt()` method combines the loaded memory information to create a comprehensive prompt for the agent to continue its workflow.
6. **Detailed Context Summary**: The `generateDetailedContext()` method generates a detailed summary of the agent's current context, including the latest handoff, personal memories, and knowledge base updates.
7. **Time Ago Calculation**: The `getTimeAgo()` method calculates the time difference between the current time and a given timestamp, returning a human-readable string.
8. **Personal Context Saving**: The `savePersonalContext()` method saves the agent's personal context to the `personal-context.json` file.
9. **Memory Searching**: The `searchMemories()` method allows searching through the agent's handoff files, personal memories, and knowledge base for specific query terms.

## Dependencies

The script has the following external dependencies:

1. `fs-extra`: A comprehensive file system library for Node.js, providing enhanced versions of the core `fs` module.
2. `path`: The built-in Node.js module for working with file and directory paths.
3. `fileURLToPath`: A utility function from the built-in `url` module, used for converting a file URL to a file path.
