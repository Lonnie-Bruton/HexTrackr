# StackTrackr Encryption Status Documentation

## Purpose & Overview

The `ENCRYPTION_STATUS.md` file in the `rProjects/StackTrackr` directory provides important information about the current status and future plans for the encryption feature in the StackTrackr application, which is part of the rEngine Core ecosystem.

This file serves as a communication tool to inform users about the temporary disabling of the encryption feature, the reasons behind this decision, and the proposed timeline for future improvements. It also outlines alternative security workflows and addresses common questions related to the encryption system.

## Key Functions/Classes

This file does not contain any code or specific functions/classes. It is a Markdown-formatted documentation file that provides textual information about the encryption status and related workflows.

## Dependencies

The `ENCRYPTION_STATUS.md` file does not have any direct dependencies. It is a standalone documentation file that provides information about the StackTrackr application, which is part of the rEngine Core platform.

## Usage Examples

This file is not meant to be used programmatically. It is intended to be read by users of the StackTrackr application to understand the current status and future plans for the encryption feature.

## Configuration

There are no configuration settings or environment variables associated with this Markdown file.

## Integration Points

The `ENCRYPTION_STATUS.md` file is part of the rProjects/StackTrackr directory, which is a component within the rEngine Core ecosystem. It provides information specific to the StackTrackr application and its encryption feature.

## Troubleshooting

The `ENCRYPTION_STATUS.md` file does not contain any troubleshooting information. It is a documentation file that addresses the temporary disabling of the encryption feature and provides guidance on alternative security workflows.

# StackTrackr Encryption Status

## Current Status: Temporarily Disabled

The encryption feature has been temporarily disabled while we improve the core inventory system. This decision was made to focus development resources on the features that users request most.

## What This Means

- **Your data is still secure** - StackTrackr stores data locally on your computer only
- **No feature loss** - All inventory, spot price, and API features work normally  
- **Cleaner interface** - Removed confusing encryption options from the API modal
- **Better stability** - Eliminated source of technical issues and user confusion

## If You Were Using Encryption

If you previously set up encryption and are seeing issues:

1. **Run the cleanup script** to remove old encryption keys:
   - Copy the contents of `cleanup-encryption.js`
   - Paste into your browser console while on the StackTrackr page
   - Press Enter to run the cleanup

1. **Alternative security workflow:**
   - Use the Export feature to save your data as CSV
   - Encrypt the CSV file using your preferred encryption tool
   - Store the encrypted file securely
   - Import the CSV when needed

## Timeline

This is part of a gradual simplification plan:

| Phase | Timeline | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 (Complete) | - | Hidden encryption UI and provided cleanup tools |
| 2 (Next month) | 1 month | Remove backend encryption code during feature development |
| 3 (Month 3) | 3 months | Complete cleanup during UI improvements |

## Questions?

The encryption system proved more complex than valuable for most users. We're focusing development time on inventory management, reporting, and mobile access instead.

If you have specific security needs, the CSV export → encrypt → import workflow provides the same protection with more flexibility and compatibility.
