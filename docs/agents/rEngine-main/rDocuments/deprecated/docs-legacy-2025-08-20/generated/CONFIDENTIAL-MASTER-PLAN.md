# rAgents: Confidential Master Plan

## Purpose & Overview

This document outlines the confidential master plan for the development and commercialization of the rAgents platform, which is an integral part of the rEngine Core ecosystem. The rAgents platform is designed to provide an "Intelligent Development Wrapper" that enhances developer productivity and efficiency through advanced AI capabilities.

The master plan covers the three key phases of development: Stealth Development, Beta Stealth, and Commercial Launch. It details the strategic objectives, technical roadmap, competitive advantages, and risk mitigation strategies for the rAgents platform.

This document is considered highly confidential and is not intended for public distribution. It should be accessible only to the core rEngine development team and trusted collaborators who have signed non-disclosure agreements.

## Key Functions/Classes

The rAgents platform consists of the following key components:

1. **StackTrackr**: The primary development and testing ground for the rAgents platform. It is used to perfect the underlying technology, including hybrid intelligence processing, persistent memory engine, and traffic cop agent.

1. **Traffic Cop Agent**: A unique AI-powered component that monitors the behavior of the rAgents platform and detects potential issues or failures, preventing problems before they occur.

1. **Research Agent**: An agent that automates the process of researching and integrating new information, building the knowledge base that powers the rAgents platform.

1. **VS Code Extension**: A Visual Studio Code extension that provides a seamless integration of the rAgents platform within the developer's IDE, enhancing productivity and user experience.

1. **Team Collaboration Features**: Functionalities that enable teams to work together more effectively, leveraging the persistent memory and shared context of the rAgents platform.

## Dependencies

The rAgents platform relies on the following key dependencies:

1. **Ollama**: The open-source large language model (LLM) that provides the foundational natural language processing capabilities for the rAgents platform.

1. **MCP (Multimodal Computation Protocol)**: The open-source protocol that enables the hybrid processing of data, combining local and cloud-based resources.

1. **Context7**: The persistent memory engine that powers the continuity and context-awareness of the rAgents platform.

## Usage Examples

While the complete details of the rAgents platform are confidential, here are some general usage examples:

1. **Hybrid AI Processing**: Developers can leverage the rAgents platform to seamlessly integrate Ollama-based processing with local and cloud-based resources, optimizing for cost and performance.

1. **Intelligent Code Assistance**: The rAgents VS Code extension can provide advanced code completion, refactoring, and debugging assistance, powered by the platform's persistent memory and pattern recognition capabilities.

1. **Automated Research and Knowledge Building**: The research agent can automatically scour the internet for relevant information, synthesize it, and integrate it into the rAgents knowledge base, empowering developers with up-to-date and contextual information.

1. **Team Collaboration**: The team collaboration features of the rAgents platform allow developers to share context, memory, and insights, fostering more efficient and productive teamwork.

## Configuration

The rAgents platform does not have any publicly accessible configuration options. All configuration and settings are managed internally within the rEngine Core ecosystem and are not exposed to end-users.

## Integration Points

The rAgents platform is tightly integrated with the following rEngine Core components:

1. **Ollama**: The rAgents platform leverages Ollama for its natural language processing capabilities and integrates with the Ollama ecosystem.

1. **MCP**: The rAgents platform utilizes the Multimodal Computation Protocol to manage the hybrid processing of data across local and cloud-based resources.

1. **Context7**: The persistent memory engine provided by Context7 is a core component of the rAgents platform, enabling continuous context and memory preservation.

## Troubleshooting

As the rAgents platform is still in development, there may be occasional technical issues or challenges. However, due to the confidential nature of the project, troubleshooting information is not publicly available. The rEngine Core development team will provide support and guidance to trusted collaborators and beta users through secure channels.
