# rEngine Core: llm-benchmark.sh Technical Documentation

## Purpose & Overview

The `llm-benchmark.sh` script is a utility provided within the rEngine Core ecosystem. Its primary purpose is to facilitate the benchmarking of large language models (LLMs) integrated with the rEngine Core platform. This script allows users to evaluate the performance and capabilities of various LLMs by running a set of predefined benchmark tasks and collecting the results.

By running this script, rEngine Core users can gain valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of different LLMs, helping them make informed decisions when selecting the most suitable model for their specific use cases and applications.

## Key Functions/Classes

The `llm-benchmark.sh` script does not define any specific functions or classes. Instead, it is a Bash script that orchestrates the benchmarking process by executing a series of tasks and collecting the results.

## Dependencies

The `llm-benchmark.sh` script relies on the following dependencies:

1. **rEngine Core SDK**: The script interacts with the rEngine Core platform and its integrated LLMs, so it requires the rEngine Core SDK to be installed and properly configured.
2. **Benchmark Tasks**: The script executes a set of predefined benchmark tasks, which are likely defined elsewhere in the rEngine Core codebase or provided as external resources.
3. **Reporting Tools**: The script may utilize various tools or libraries to generate reports or visualizations of the benchmark results.

## Usage Examples

To use the `llm-benchmark.sh` script, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the rEngine Core SDK is installed and configured correctly.
2. Navigate to the `scripts` directory where the `llm-benchmark.sh` script is located.
3. Run the script using the following command:

```bash
./llm-benchmark.sh
```

The script will execute the predefined benchmark tasks and display the results. Depending on the specific implementation, the script may offer additional options or parameters to customize the benchmarking process.

## Configuration

The `llm-benchmark.sh` script may require certain environment variables or configuration settings to be set before running. These may include:

| Environment Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `RENGINE_API_KEY` | The API key required to authenticate with the rEngine Core platform. |
| `BENCHMARK_TASKS_DIR` | The directory containing the definitions for the benchmark tasks. |
| `REPORT_OUTPUT_DIR` | The directory where the benchmark results will be saved. |

Make sure to set these variables or update the script's configuration accordingly before running the benchmark.

## Integration Points

The `llm-benchmark.sh` script is an integral part of the rEngine Core ecosystem, as it allows users to evaluate and compare the performance of different LLMs integrated with the platform. The script can be used in the following integration points:

1. **Model Selection**: By running the benchmark, users can assess the capabilities of various LLMs and choose the most suitable model for their specific use cases.
2. **Performance Monitoring**: The script can be used to periodically benchmark LLMs, allowing users to track changes in performance over time and identify any regressions or improvements.
3. **Continuous Integration**: The script can be integrated into the rEngine Core's continuous integration (CI) pipeline to automatically run benchmarks and ensure the quality of LLM integrations.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while running the `llm-benchmark.sh` script, here are some common problems and potential solutions:

1. **Dependency Issues**:
   - Ensure that the rEngine Core SDK is properly installed and configured.
   - Verify that all required benchmark task definitions and reporting tools are available and accessible.

1. **Authentication Errors**:
   - Check that the `RENGINE_API_KEY` environment variable is set correctly and that the API key is valid.

1. **Benchmark Task Failures**:
   - Verify that the benchmark task definitions are correct and compatible with the integrated LLMs.
   - Check the script's logging or output for any error messages that may provide more information about the failures.

1. **Reporting Issues**:
   - Ensure that the `REPORT_OUTPUT_DIR` environment variable is set correctly and that the script has the necessary permissions to write the report files.
   - Investigate any issues with the reporting tools or libraries used by the script.

If you continue to experience issues after troubleshooting, please refer to the rEngine Core documentation or reach out to the rEngine Core support team for further assistance.
