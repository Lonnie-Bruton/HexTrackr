# rEngine Core: `fuzzy-search.test.js` Documentation

## Purpose & Overview

The `fuzzy-search.test.js` file is a test suite for the `fuzzySearch` function, which is part of the `rEngine Core` platform. The `fuzzySearch` function is used to perform a fuzzy text search on a set of target strings, and this test suite ensures that the function behaves as expected.

## Key Functions/Classes

### `fuzzySearch(query, targets)`

The `fuzzySearch` function takes two parameters:

1. `query`: The search query string.
2. `targets`: An array of target strings to search.

The function returns an array of search result objects, where each object has the following properties:

- `text`: The target string that matched the query.
- `score`: The similarity score between the query and the target string.

## Dependencies

The `fuzzy-search.test.js` file depends on the following:

1. The `assert` module from Node.js, which is used for writing test assertions.
2. The `fuzzy-search.js` module, which contains the implementation of the `fuzzySearch` function.

## Usage Examples

To use the `fuzzySearch` function, you can call it like this:

```javascript
const { fuzzySearch } = require('../js/fuzzy-search.js');

const targets = ['American Gold Eagle', 'American Silver Eagle'];
const results = fuzzySearch('Silver Eagle', targets);

console.log(results);
```

This will output an array of search result objects, where each object represents a target string that matched the query.

## Configuration

The `fuzzy-search.test.js` file does not require any specific configuration. It is a test suite that can be run as part of the rEngine Core test suite.

## Integration Points

The `fuzzySearch` function is a core component of the rEngine Core platform, and it can be used in various parts of the system that require fuzzy text search functionality. For example, it could be used in a search engine or a recommendation system.

## Troubleshooting

Since this file is a test suite, there are no specific troubleshooting steps. If the tests fail, it means that the `fuzzySearch` function is not behaving as expected, and the issue should be investigated in the `fuzzy-search.js` module.
