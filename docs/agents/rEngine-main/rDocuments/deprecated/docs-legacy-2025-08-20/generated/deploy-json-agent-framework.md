# rEngine Core: deploy-json-agent-framework.sh

## Purpose & Overview

The `deploy-json-agent-framework.sh` script is a crucial component in the rEngine Core ecosystem. It is responsible for deploying the complete JSON-first agentic operating system to any new project, providing a streamlined and automated way to set up the necessary file structure, configuration, and documentation for a project utilizing the rEngine Core platform.

This script serves as the foundation for initializing new projects with the rEngine JSON-first agent framework, ensuring a consistent and organized development environment that leverages the power of the rEngine Core's intelligent agent-based architecture.

## Key Functions/Classes

1. **Directory Structure Creation**: The script creates the necessary directory structure for the new project, including folders for agents, documentation, scripts, and other essential components.

1. **File Copying**: The script copies a set of core JSON files, documentation files, and engine/script files from the source project to the target project directory.

1. **Project Customization**: The script updates specific files (e.g., `agents.json`, `memory.json`, `unified-workflow.md`) with the new project name to ensure a seamless integration.

1. **Backup System Setup**: The script creates a backup script (`backup_system.sh`) that can be used to backup the project's JSON-first agent system.

1. **Quick Start Guide Generation**: The script generates a `QUICK_START.md` file that provides a step-by-step guide for initializing the project and leveraging the rEngine Core's agent-based workflows.

## Dependencies

The `deploy-json-agent-framework.sh` script depends on the following components:

1. **rEngine Core Platform**: The script is designed to work within the rEngine Core ecosystem, leveraging its JSON-first agentic architecture and development conventions.

1. **Source Project**: The script requires a source project directory (`/Volumes/DATA/GitHub/rEngine` in the example) that contains the necessary files and directories to be copied to the new project.

1. **Python 3**: The backup script (`backup_system.sh`) generated by the deployment script requires Python 3 to be installed on the target system.

## Usage Examples

To use the `deploy-json-agent-framework.sh` script, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the source project directory is set correctly in the script.
2. Run the script with the target project path and (optionally) the new project name as arguments:

   ```bash
   ./deploy-json-agent-framework.sh /path/to/MyNewProject MyNewProject
   ```

1. The script will create the target project directory, copy the necessary files, and customize the project-specific information.
2. Review the `QUICK_START.md` file in the target project directory for further instructions on initializing the project and leveraging the rEngine Core's agent-based workflows.

## Configuration

The `deploy-json-agent-framework.sh` script does not require any specific environment variables or configuration. However, the script does rely on the following parameters:

- `SOURCE_PROJECT`: The path to the source project directory containing the files to be copied.
- `TARGET_PROJECT`: The path to the target project directory where the files will be deployed.
- `PROJECT_NAME`: The name of the new project, which is used to customize certain files.

## Integration Points

The `deploy-json-agent-framework.sh` script is a core component of the rEngine Core platform, responsible for setting up new projects with the necessary infrastructure for leveraging the JSON-first agentic operating system. It integrates with the following rEngine Core components:

1. **Agent Protocols**: The script copies the core JSON files (e.g., `agents.json`, `memory.json`) that define the agent protocols and data structures used throughout the rEngine Core platform.

1. **Documentation**: The script copies the relevant documentation files (e.g., `unified-workflow.md`, `naming-guidelines.md`) that provide guidance on working with the rEngine Core's agent-based development workflows.

1. **Backup System**: The script creates a backup script (`backup_system.sh`) that can be used to backup the project's JSON-first agent system, ensuring the integrity of the project data.

1. **Quick Start Guide**: The script generates a `QUICK_START.md` file that helps new users quickly understand how to initialize the project and leverage the rEngine Core's agent-based development capabilities.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Missing Source Files**: If the script encounters a missing source file, it will print a warning message indicating the missing file. Ensure that the source project directory (`SOURCE_PROJECT`) is correctly set and that all the required files are present.

1. **Permission Issues**: Make sure that the script has the necessary permissions to create directories and copy files. If you encounter any permission-related issues, try running the script with elevated privileges (e.g., `sudo ./deploy-json-agent-framework.sh ...`).

1. **Python 3 Dependency**: The backup script (`backup_system.sh`) generated by the deployment script requires Python 3 to be installed on the target system. If you encounter issues with the backup script, ensure that Python 3 is properly installed and accessible.

1. **Project Customization Errors**: If the script encounters any issues when updating the project-specific files (e.g., `agents.json`, `memory.json`, `unified-workflow.md`), check the target project directory for any backup files (e.g., `*.bak`) and try re-running the script.

If you encounter any other issues or have further questions, please consult the rEngine Core documentation or reach out to the support team for assistance.
