# VulnTrackr Documentation

## Purpose & Overview

The `VulnTrackr` project is a comprehensive vulnerability management solution built as part of the rEngine Core ecosystem. It serves as an "Intelligent Development Wrapper" for handling various vulnerability data sources, processing them, and providing a unified dashboard for security teams to track and analyze their organization's security posture.

The `PROJECT_STATUS.md` file provides a detailed overview of the VulnTrackr project, including its current status, roadmap, architecture, technical stack, and quality assurance measures. This file is intended to serve as a central reference point for all stakeholders involved in the development and deployment of the VulnTrackr application.

## Key Functions/Classes

The VulnTrackr project encompasses the following key components:

1. **Data Processing**: Handles the ingestion and processing of vulnerability data from various sources, such as CSV files, APIs, and log files.
2. **VPR Calculation Engine**: Responsible for automatically scoring the severity of identified vulnerabilities using the Vulnerability Priority Rating (VPR) system.
3. **Visualization Dashboard**: Provides an interactive user interface with charts and graphs to visualize vulnerability data, trends, and insights.
4. **Historical Tracking**: Enables the storage and retrieval of vulnerability data over time, allowing for trend analysis and historical reporting.
5. **Deployment Automation**: Includes containerization and deployment scripts to ensure a consistent and production-ready environment.

## Dependencies

The VulnTrackr project relies on the following external dependencies:

- **Frontend**: HTML5, Vanilla JavaScript, CSS3
- **Visualization**: Chart.js 3.x
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage
- **Deployment**: Docker + Nginx
- **Containerization**: Docker Compose

For the planned future architecture (v2.0.0), the project will also integrate with the following components:

- **Backend API**: Node.js/Express or Python/FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for scalability
- **Authentication**: JWT with RBAC
- **Real-time**: WebSocket connections
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana

## Usage Examples

The VulnTrackr project can be used in the following ways:

1. **Local Development and Testing**:

   ```bash

   # Current development setup

   cd /Volumes/DATA/GitHub/rEngine/rProjects/VulnTrackr

   # Local testing

   python3 -m http.server 8080

   # Docker testing

   docker build -t vulntrackr:1.0.0 .
   docker run -p 8080:80 vulntrackr:1.0.0
   ```

1. **API Integration**:

   ```bash

   # API integration (when ready)

   # Update enhanced-api-integration.js with real endpoints

   # Test with provided Tenable credentials

   ```

## Configuration

The VulnTrackr project currently does not require any specific environment variables or configuration files. The planned future architecture (v2.0.0) may introduce configuration requirements for the backend API, database, and other integrated components.

## Integration Points

The VulnTrackr project is designed to be a modular and flexible component within the rEngine Core ecosystem. It integrates with the following key components:

1. **Data Sources**: VulnTrackr can ingest vulnerability data from various sources, such as CSV files, APIs (e.g., Tenable.io, Qualys, Rapid7), and log files (e.g., Splunk, QRadar, Azure Sentinel).
2. **Vulnerability Scoring**: The VPR calculation engine within VulnTrackr can be used by other rEngine Core components to provide standardized vulnerability scoring and prioritization.
3. **Visualization and Reporting**: The VulnTrackr dashboard can be integrated with other rEngine Core components to provide a unified view of an organization's security posture.
4. **Deployment and Containerization**: The Docker-based deployment and containerization of VulnTrackr can be leveraged by other rEngine Core components to ensure consistent and scalable deployments.

## Troubleshooting

The VulnTrackr project has the following known issues and troubleshooting guidance:

1. **API Integration Delays**: The project is currently awaiting API credentials from the Tenable.io vendor to implement the real API integration. This is a blocker for the v1.1.0 release, which is expected to be delivered in Q1 2025.

1. **Performance with Large Datasets**: The project has set performance targets for handling large volumes of vulnerability data, but these have not yet been fully validated. Users may experience slower performance when working with very large datasets.

1. **Automated Testing Coverage**: The project currently relies on manual testing, but plans to introduce automated testing, including integration testing and performance testing, in the v1.1.0 release.

If you encounter any other issues or have questions about the VulnTrackr project, please refer to the comprehensive documentation suite or reach out to the project owner, Lonnie Bruton, for further assistance.
