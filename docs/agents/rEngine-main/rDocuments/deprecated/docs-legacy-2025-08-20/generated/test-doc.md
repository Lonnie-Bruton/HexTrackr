# test-doc.js Documentation

## Purpose & Overview

The `test-doc.js` script is a simple example file used to demonstrate the process of creating comprehensive technical documentation. This script simply logs the message "Hello World" to the console, but the documentation provided here can be applied to more complex and functional scripts as well.

## Technical Architecture

The `test-doc.js` script is a standalone Node.js script that can be executed from the command line. It has a very simple structure, consisting of a single `console.log()` statement.

## Dependencies

This script has no external dependencies. It only uses the built-in `console` module provided by the Node.js runtime.

## Key Functions/Classes

### `console.log()`

- **Purpose**: Writes a message to the console.
- **Parameters**:
  - `message` (string): The message to be logged.
- **Return Value**: `undefined`

## Usage Examples

To run the `test-doc.js` script, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the script, and execute the following command:

```
node test-doc.js
```

This will output the following message to the console:

```
Hello World
```

## Configuration

This script has no configuration options or environment variables.

## Error Handling

Since this script is very simple, there are no explicit error handling mechanisms. However, if any unexpected errors occur during the execution of the script, they will be reported by the Node.js runtime.

## Integration

This script is a standalone example and is not intended to be integrated into a larger system. It can be used as a starting point for creating more complex documentation.

## Development Notes

The `test-doc.js` script is a minimal example used to demonstrate the documentation process. In a real-world scenario, the documentation would be much more extensive, covering the script's purpose, architecture, usage, and any other relevant information.
