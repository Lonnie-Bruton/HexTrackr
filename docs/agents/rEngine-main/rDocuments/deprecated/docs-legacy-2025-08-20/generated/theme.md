# rEngine Core: theme.js Documentation

## Purpose & Overview

The `theme.js` file is responsible for managing the application's theming functionality within the rEngine Core ecosystem. It provides a set of functions to set, toggle, and initialize the theme, as well as set up a system-level theme change listener. This allows users to switch between different theme modes (dark, light, and sepia) and ensures that the application's appearance is consistent with the user's system-level preferences.

## Key Functions/Classes

### `setTheme(theme)`

This function sets the application's theme and updates the corresponding value in the browser's local storage.

## Parameters:

- `theme` (string): The theme to be set, can be 'dark', 'light', or 'sepia'.

## Example Usage:

```javascript
setTheme('dark');
```

### `initTheme()`

This function initializes the application's theme based on the user's preferences and system settings. It first checks if a theme is saved in local storage, and if not, it defaults to the system's preferred color scheme (dark or light).

## Example Usage: (2)

```javascript
initTheme();
```

### `toggleTheme()`

This function cycles through the available themes in the order: dark → light → sepia → dark.

## Example Usage: (3)

```javascript
toggleTheme();
```

### `setupSystemThemeListener()`

This function sets up a listener for system-level theme changes. If the user's system preference changes, the application's theme will automatically update (unless the user has explicitly set a theme).

## Example Usage: (4)

```javascript
setupSystemThemeListener();
```

## Dependencies

The `theme.js` file does not have any direct dependencies. However, it relies on the existence of a global `renderTable()` function, which is likely defined elsewhere in the application.

## Usage Examples

To use the theming functionality provided by `theme.js`, you can call the exposed functions in your application code:

```javascript
// Set the theme to 'dark'
setTheme('dark');

// Toggle the theme
toggleTheme();

// Initialize the theme based on user preferences and system settings
initTheme();

// Set up the system theme change listener
setupSystemThemeListener();
```

## Configuration

The `theme.js` file uses the `THEME_KEY` constant to store the user's selected theme in the browser's local storage. This constant is not defined within the `theme.js` file, so it must be defined elsewhere in the application.

## Integration Points

The `theme.js` file is an integral part of the rEngine Core ecosystem, as it provides a consistent and user-friendly way to manage the application's theming. It can be used in conjunction with other rEngine Core components that require theming functionality, such as the user interface or data visualization components.

## Troubleshooting

## Issue: The theme is not being applied correctly.

## Solution:

1. Ensure that the `THEME_KEY` constant is properly defined and matches the key used to store the theme in the browser's local storage.
2. Check if the `renderTable()` function is defined and properly implemented.
3. Verify that the `setTheme()` function is being called correctly in your application code.

## Issue: The system theme change listener is not working.

## Solution: (2)

1. Ensure that the `setupSystemThemeListener()` function is being called at the appropriate time in your application's lifecycle.
2. Verify that the `window.matchMedia()` API is supported by the browsers you're targeting.
3. Check if there are any other event listeners or code that might be interfering with the system theme change listener.

If you encounter any other issues, please refer to the rEngine Core documentation or reach out to the development team for further assistance.
