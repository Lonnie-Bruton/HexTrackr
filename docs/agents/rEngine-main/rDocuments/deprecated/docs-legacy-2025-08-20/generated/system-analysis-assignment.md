# rPrompts: System Analysis Assignment

## Purpose & Overview

The `system-analysis-assignment.md` file in the `rAgents/rLegacy/docs/rPrompts` directory of the rEngine Core platform provides a template and instructions for conducting a comprehensive system analysis. This file is intended to be used by the `Claude Sonnet` agent, which is optimized for detailed system analysis tasks.

The analysis scope, focus areas, and depth required are specified in the file, along with references to relevant files and an analysis framework to follow. The goal is to produce a thorough understanding of the system, identify strengths, weaknesses, and improvement opportunities, and create an actionable implementation roadmap.

## Key Functions/Classes

The main components and their roles in this system analysis assignment are:

1. **Agent**: `Claude Sonnet` - An agent optimized for comprehensive system analysis tasks.
2. **Analysis Scope**: The specific system or component to be analyzed.
3. **Focus Areas**: The areas of focus for the analysis, such as architecture, performance, security, etc.
4. **Depth Required**: The level of detail required for the analysis (surface, detailed, or comprehensive).
5. **Analysis Framework**: The steps to follow, including current state assessment, strengths and weaknesses identification, performance bottlenecks, security considerations, improvement opportunities, and implementation recommendations.

## Dependencies

This system analysis assignment relies on the following files and resources:

- `agents/tasks.json`: Contains the analysis requirements.
- `agents/structure.json`: Provides information about the current system architecture.
- `agents/functions.json`: Lists the function registry and dependencies.
- `agents/patterns.json`: Outlines the existing patterns and conventions.
- `agents/dependencies.json`: Specifies the system dependencies.

## Usage Examples

To use the system analysis assignment, follow these steps:

1. Read the analysis requirements in the `agents/tasks.json` file.
2. Update the status to "in_progress".
3. Follow the phases outlined in the assignment:
   - Explore the system
   - Analyze the system
   - Document the findings
   - Provide recommendations
1. Update the memory with the architectural insights gained during the analysis.

## Configuration

There are no specific configuration requirements for this system analysis assignment. The assignment relies on the files and resources mentioned in the "Dependencies" section.

## Integration Points

The system analysis assignment is part of the rEngine Core platform and is intended to be used by the `Claude Sonnet` agent to provide comprehensive analysis of the system or component under investigation. The findings and recommendations from this analysis can be used to inform and guide the ongoing development and maintenance of the rEngine Core platform.

## Troubleshooting

There are no known common issues or troubleshooting steps specific to this system analysis assignment. However, if any issues arise during the analysis process, it is recommended to review the referenced files and resources, as well as consult with the rEngine Core development team for further assistance.
