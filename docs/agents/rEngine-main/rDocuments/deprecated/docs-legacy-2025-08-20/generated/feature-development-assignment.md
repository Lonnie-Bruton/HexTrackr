# rPrompts: Feature Development Assignment

## Purpose & Overview

The `feature-development-assignment.md` file in the `rAgents/rLegacy/docs/rPrompts/` directory of the rEngine Core platform provides a template and guidelines for developers tasked with implementing new features. This file serves as a starting point for feature development, outlining the key requirements, architectural considerations, integration points, and success criteria.

## Key Functions/Classes

The file does not contain any specific code or classes, but rather provides a structured template for feature development tasks. The main components included are:

1. **Feature Requirements**: A detailed description of the new feature to be implemented.
2. **User Story**: A user-centric description of the feature's goal and benefits.
3. **Architecture Considerations**: Technical requirements and constraints for the feature implementation.
4. **Integration Points**: Existing systems that the new feature will need to integrate with.
5. **Task Instructions**: Step-by-step guidelines for the developer to follow during the feature development process.
6. **Reference Files**: Pointers to other relevant system documentation.
7. **Success Criteria**: The expected outcomes and quality standards for the completed feature.

## Dependencies

The `feature-development-assignment.md` file does not have any direct dependencies, but it references the following files within the rEngine Core platform:

- `agents/tasks.json`: Contains the detailed feature specifications.
- `agents/structure.json`: Describes the system architecture.
- `agents/functions.json`: Registry of existing functions.
- `agents/styles.json`: UI/UX guidelines.

These files provide the necessary context and information for the developer to successfully implement the new feature.

## Usage Examples

To use the `feature-development-assignment.md` file, follow these steps:

1. Read the feature specifications in the `agents/tasks.json` file.
2. Update the status of the feature to "in_progress".
3. Follow the four development phases outlined in the file:
   - Analyze
   - Design
   - Code
   - Test
1. Update the memory file and document the progress.
2. Ensure the feature meets the success criteria before marking it as complete.

```

1. Read feature specifications in `agents/tasks.json`
2. Update status to "in_progress"
3. Follow phases: analyze → design → code → test
4. Update memory file and document progress

```

## Configuration

The `feature-development-assignment.md` file does not require any specific configuration or environment variables. It is a guidance document that provides a structured approach to feature development within the rEngine Core platform.

## Integration Points

The new feature being developed should integrate cleanly with the existing rEngine Core system. The `Integration Points` section of the file highlights the existing systems that will be affected by the new feature, and developers should consider these integration points during the design and implementation phases.

## Troubleshooting

Since the `feature-development-assignment.md` file is a guidance document, there are no specific troubleshooting steps. However, if developers encounter any issues during the feature development process, they should refer to the relevant system documentation, such as the `agents/structure.json`, `agents/functions.json`, and `agents/styles.json` files, for additional context and support.
