# rEngine Core - `process_gpt_import.sh` Documentation

## Purpose & Overview

The `process_gpt_import.sh` script is a crucial component in the rEngine Core ecosystem, responsible for safely integrating changes made by the ChatGPT/GPT5 language models back into the project. This script handles the import process, ensuring that any modifications or additions from the GPT models are thoroughly validated and intelligently merged into the codebase, while also creating backups and updating relevant timestamps.

The script serves as a safeguard, enabling seamless and reliable integration of AI-generated content or code changes into the rEngine Core platform, ensuring the stability and consistency of the overall system.

## Key Functions/Classes

The script is divided into several key functions that handle different aspects of the import process:

1. **`detect_import_type()`**: Determines the type of import (zip file, folder, or individual files) based on the contents of the `portable_exchange` directory.
2. **`process_zip_import()`**: Extracts and processes a zip file import, finding the extracted project directory.
3. **`process_folder_import()`**: Locates and processes a folder import.
4. **`validate_changes()`**: Validates the imported files, checking for invalid JSON and the presence of critical files.
5. **`create_backup()`**: Creates a backup of key project directories before the import is applied.
6. **`merge_changes()`**: Intelligently merges the modified files from the import into the project, handling both updated and new files.
7. **`update_timestamps()`**: Updates the metadata timestamps in the project's memory, bugs, roadmap, and tasks JSON files.
8. **`show_git_status()`**: Displays the current git status of the project, highlighting any changes detected.
9. **`cleanup()`**: Removes temporary files and optionally archives the processed import files.
10. **`main()`**: The main entry point that orchestrates the entire import process.

## Dependencies

The `process_gpt_import.sh` script has the following dependencies:

- **Bash**: The script is written in Bash and requires a compatible shell environment.
- **Python 3**: The script uses the Python 3 `json.tool` module to validate JSON files.
- **Git**: The script checks the git status of the project, assuming the project is under version control.

## Usage Examples

To use the `process_gpt_import.sh` script, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the `portable_exchange` directory is present in the project root.
2. Run the script from the project root directory:

   ```bash
   ./rAgents/rScripts/process_gpt_import.sh
   ```

   The script will automatically detect the import type, process the changes, create a backup, and merge the modifications into the project.

1. After the import is complete, the script will provide a summary of the actions taken, including the backup location and any git changes detected.

## Configuration

The `process_gpt_import.sh` script does not require any specific configuration, as it relies on the structure and contents of the `portable_exchange` directory. However, the script does use some environment variables and directories that can be customized:

- `SCRIPT_DIR`: The directory containing the script.
- `PROJECT_ROOT`: The root directory of the rEngine Core project.
- `EXCHANGE_DIR`: The directory where the imported files are located (default is `$PROJECT_ROOT/portable_exchange`).

## Integration Points

The `process_gpt_import.sh` script is a critical component in the rEngine Core ecosystem, as it enables the seamless integration of AI-generated content or code changes into the project. It is typically invoked as part of the overall rEngine Core development workflow, either manually or as part of an automated build/deployment process.

Other rEngine Core components that may interact with or depend on the `process_gpt_import.sh` script include:

- **Package Generation**: The script is likely triggered after the `npm run package-gpt` command, which generates the `portable_exchange` directory containing the files to be imported.
- **Build/Deployment Automation**: The script may be incorporated into the project's CI/CD pipeline to ensure that any GPT-generated changes are properly integrated during the build or deployment process.
- **Developer Workflow**: Developers working on the rEngine Core project may manually run the script to integrate their own GPT-generated modifications or updates.

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues and solutions related to the `process_gpt_import.sh` script:

### 1. "No valid import files found in portable_exchange/"

**Cause**: The `portable_exchange` directory does not contain any recognized import files (zip file or StackTrackr folder).

**Solution**: Ensure that the `npm run package-gpt` command has been run successfully, creating the necessary files in the `portable_exchange` directory.

### 2. "Validation failed with X errors"

**Cause**: The imported files contain invalid JSON or are missing critical files (e.g., `index.html`, `agents/memory.json`, `agents/bugs.json`).

**Solution**: Review the error messages and address the issues in the imported files before running the script again.

### 3. "Git changes detected"

**Cause**: The script has detected changes in the project's git repository that may need to be reviewed and committed.

**Solution**: Examine the git status output, review the changes, and decide whether to commit them or discard them before proceeding with the import.

### 4. "portable_exchange/ directory not found"

**Cause**: The `portable_exchange` directory does not exist in the project root.

**Solution**: Ensure that the `npm run package-gpt` command has been run successfully to create the `portable_exchange` directory.
