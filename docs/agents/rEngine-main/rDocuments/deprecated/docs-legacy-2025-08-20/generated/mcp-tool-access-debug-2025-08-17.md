## Purpose & Overview

This file is a technical report investigating an issue with accessing the `analyze_with_ai` and other rEngineMCP tools through the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) MCP interface. It provides insights into the available and missing tools, the suspected root cause, and the next steps to resolve the problem.

This report is valuable for the rEngine Core ecosystem as it helps identify and troubleshoot integration issues between the rEngineMCP system and the VS Code development environment, which is a critical part of the rEngine Core platform.

## Key Functions/Classes

This file does not contain any code, but rather a technical report in Markdown format. The key components are:

1. **Issue Discovery**: Describes the problem of not seeing the expected rEngineMCP tools in the VS Code MCP interface.
2. **Available Tools**: Lists the MCP tools that are currently visible, such as Memory MCP tools and GitHub tools.
3. **Missing Tools**: Identifies the specific rEngineMCP tools that are not available, such as `analyze_with_ai`, `rapid_context_search`, `get_instant_code_target`, and `vscode_system_status`.
4. **Theory**: Proposes a theory that the rEngineMCP server needs to be running and connected to VS Code for the tools to appear.
5. **Next Steps**: Outlines the steps to be taken to investigate and resolve the issue, such as checking the rEngineMCP server status and verifying the VS Code MCP configuration.

## Dependencies

This report does not have any direct dependencies, as it is a standalone Markdown file. However, it is closely related to the rEngineMCP system and the integration between rEngine Core and the VS Code development environment.

## Usage Examples

This file is not a software component, but rather a technical report. It is intended to be read and used by rEngine Core developers and support personnel to understand and troubleshoot issues related to the accessibility of rEngineMCP tools in the VS Code MCP interface.

## Configuration

This report does not require any specific configuration. However, the resolution of the issue may involve configuring the rEngineMCP server and the VS Code MCP integration.

## Integration Points

This report is directly related to the integration between the rEngineMCP system and the VS Code development environment, which is a crucial part of the rEngine Core platform. The report highlights the importance of this integration and the need to ensure that the rEngineMCP tools are properly accessible through the VS Code MCP interface.

## Troubleshooting

The main troubleshooting steps outlined in this report are:

1. Check if the rEngineMCP server is running properly.
2. Verify the VS Code MCP configuration to ensure that it includes the rEngineMCP integration.
3. Look for the missing rEngineMCP tools in the `@use` statements in the VS Code Chat interface.

These steps are intended to help identify and resolve the root cause of the issue, which is preventing the rEngineMCP tools from being accessible in the VS Code MCP interface.
