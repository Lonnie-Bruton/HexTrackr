This file provides advanced multi-vendor API support, enabling seamless integration with various security solutions, such as:

- Tenable.io
- Qualys VMDR
- Rapid7 InsightVM

It handles vendor-specific data formats, device-level tracking, and customized visualization features.

### Configuration Files

#### `Dockerfile`

The `Dockerfile` defines the build configuration for the `VulnTrackr` application, using the `nginx:alpine` base image and exposing port 80 for web access.

#### `docker-compose.yml`

The `docker-compose.yml` file allows for the deployment of the `VulnTrackr` application as a containerized service, including a persistent data volume for storing user-uploaded files and application state.

### Documentation Structure

The `VulnTrackr` project includes a comprehensive documentation structure, covering both technical and user-oriented aspects:

- `README.md`: Provides a high-level overview and quick start guide for the project.
- `ROADMAP.md`: Outlines the development roadmap and upcoming milestones.
- `TECHNICAL_SPECS.md`: Delves into the architecture and implementation details of the application.
- `DEPLOYMENT.md`: Offers guidance on deploying the `VulnTrackr` application in a production environment.
- `docs/user-guide/`: Contains tutorials and workflows for end-users.
- `docs/api/`: Includes API documentation and integration examples.
- `docs/developer-guide/`: Covers the development setup and contribution guidelines.

## Dependencies

The `VulnTrackr` application relies on the following key dependencies:

1. **Chart.js**: A popular open-source library for creating interactive and responsive data visualizations.
2. **Tenable.io, Qualys VMDR, Rapid7 InsightVM**: Security vendor APIs that provide vulnerability data and integration capabilities.
3. **LocalStorage**: The browser's built-in storage mechanism for persisting application state and user data.
4. **Nginx**: The web server used to serve the `VulnTrackr` application in a containerized environment.

## Usage Examples

### Local Development Setup

To set up the `VulnTrackr` application for local development, follow these steps:

```bash

# Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/lbruton/StackTrackr.git
cd StackTrackr/rProjects/VulnTrackr

# Start the development server

python3 -m http.server 8080

# Or use Node.js

npx serve -s . -l 8080
```

This will start a local development server and allow you to access the `VulnTrackr` application at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Docker Development

To run the `VulnTrackr` application in a Docker environment, use the following commands:

```bash

# Build the development image

docker build -t vulntrackr:dev .

# Run the container with live reload (bind mount)

docker run -p 8080:80 \
  -v $(pwd):/usr/share/nginx/html \
  vulntrackr:dev
```

This will build a Docker image for the `VulnTrackr` application and run it with a bind mount, allowing for live code changes during development.

## Configuration

The `VulnTrackr` application uses the following configuration files:

- `Dockerfile`: Defines the container build configuration.
- `docker-compose.yml`: Specifies the multi-container deployment setup.
- `config/nginx.conf`: Holds the Nginx web server configuration.
- `config/docker.env`: Contains Docker environment variables.
- `config/kubernetes/`: Includes Kubernetes deployment manifests.

These configuration files are responsible for setting up the development and production environments for the `VulnTrackr` application.

## Integration Points

The `VulnTrackr` application is designed to integrate seamlessly with the `rEngine Core` ecosystem. Key integration points include:

1. **API Integrations**: The `enhanced-api-integration.js` file provides a centralized interface for connecting to various security vendor APIs, such as Tenable.io, Qualys VMDR, and Rapid7 InsightVM.
2. **Data Processing**: The application's modular architecture, with components like `data-processor.js`, enables efficient data handling and transformation for visualization and reporting.
3. **Visualization**: The integration with Chart.js allows the `VulnTrackr` application to leverage the powerful data visualization capabilities within the `rEngine Core` ecosystem.
4. **Deployment**: The `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` files facilitate the containerization and deployment of the `VulnTrackr` application, aligning with the `rEngine Core` infrastructure.

## Troubleshooting

### API Integration Issues

If you encounter issues with the security vendor API integrations, such as authentication problems or data retrieval errors, check the following:

1. Ensure that the API credentials (e.g., API keys, tokens) are correctly configured in the `config/docker.env` file.
2. Verify that the API endpoints and request parameters are up-to-date with the vendor's documentation.
3. Review the `enhanced-api-integration.js` file for any vendor-specific handling or error management that may need to be adjusted.

### Rendering or Performance Problems

If you experience issues with chart rendering or overall application performance, consider the following:

1. Optimize the data processing and visualization logic in the `data-processor.js` and `chart-manager.js` modules.
2. Ensure that the test datasets in the `csvhistory/` directory are properly formatted and representative of real-world scenarios.
3. Analyze the application's resource utilization (CPU, memory, network) and identify any bottlenecks.

### Deployment Challenges

If you encounter problems during the deployment of the `VulnTrackr` application, check the following:

1. Verify the configuration files (e.g., `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, Kubernetes manifests) for any syntax errors or missing dependencies.
2. Ensure that the necessary infrastructure (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) is properly set up and accessible.
3. Review the deployment scripts in the `scripts/` directory for any issues with the automation process.
