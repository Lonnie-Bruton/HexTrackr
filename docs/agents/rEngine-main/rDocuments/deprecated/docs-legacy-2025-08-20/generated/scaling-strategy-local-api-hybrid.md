# üåê rAgents Scaling Strategy: Local + API Hybrid Architecture

## Purpose & Overview

This file outlines the scaling strategy and architecture for the rAgents system, an "Intelligent Development Wrapper" within the rEngine Core platform. The rAgents system aims to provide an infinitely scalable AI team to support software development tasks, from conversation management to code review and documentation.

The key focus of this scaling strategy is to enable developers to start with a small local setup on an M4 Mac Mini, and then seamlessly scale up to a hybrid architecture utilizing both local and remote API-based AI workers as the "AI team" grows. This approach allows for cost optimization, performance flexibility, and specialized expertise to be applied where needed.

## Key Functions/Classes

1. **Local Ollama Server**: A local server that provides access to specific Ollama language models for core tasks like conversation, documentation, and code review.
2. **Ollama API Workers**: A set of remote API endpoints that can be utilized for specialized tasks like research, testing, and performance analysis, allowing the system to scale beyond the local hardware constraints.
3. **Worker Load Balancer**: A component responsible for intelligently routing tasks to the appropriate Ollama API worker based on the task type and available resources.

## Dependencies

The rAgents scaling strategy relies on the following dependencies:

1. **Ollama Language Models**: The rAgents system utilizes pre-trained Ollama language models to power its various AI capabilities.
2. **rEngine Core Platform**: The rAgents system is an integral part of the rEngine Core platform, which provides the overall framework and infrastructure for the system.

## Usage Examples

### Local Ollama Server

```javascript
const localOllamaServer = new LocalOllamaServer();

// Query local Ollama models
const response = await localOllamaServer.queryLocal('scribe', 'Write a summary of this document.');
```

### Ollama API Workers

```javascript
const ollamaApiWorkers = new OllamaAPIWorkers();

// Delegate a task to the API worker pool
const response = await ollamaApiWorkers.delegateToAPI('research', {
  prompt: 'Provide a summary of the latest advancements in language models.',
  priority: 'high'
});
```

## Configuration

The rAgents scaling strategy requires the following configuration:

1. **Local Ollama Server**: The `LocalOllamaServer` class needs to be configured with the appropriate Ollama model IDs for the local tasks.
2. **Ollama API Workers**: The `OllamaAPIWorkers` class needs to be configured with the API endpoint URLs and the corresponding task specialties for each worker.

These configurations can be stored in environment variables or a central configuration file within the rEngine Core platform.

## Integration Points

The rAgents scaling strategy is a core component of the rEngine Core platform, responsible for managing the AI team that supports various development tasks. It integrates with the following rEngine Core components:

1. **Task Orchestration**: The rAgents system works with the task orchestration layer to delegate tasks to the appropriate AI workers, whether local or remote.
2. **Resource Management**: The rAgents system leverages the resource management capabilities of rEngine Core to optimize cost and performance across the hybrid architecture.
3. **Developer Interface**: The rAgents system exposes its capabilities through the rEngine Core developer interface, allowing developers to seamlessly utilize the AI team for their development tasks.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Local Ollama Server Latency**: If the local Ollama server is experiencing high latency, you may need to optimize the hardware resources of the M4 Mac Mini or consider offloading more tasks to the Ollama API workers.
2. **Ollama API Worker Availability**: If the Ollama API workers are experiencing high demand or downtime, the load balancer may not be able to route tasks effectively. You may need to scale the API worker pool or investigate any issues with the remote API endpoints.
3. **Cost Overruns**: If the overall cost of the rAgents system is exceeding your budget, review the usage patterns and consider optimizing the balance between local and API-based processing.

In general, the rAgents scaling strategy is designed to provide a seamless and cost-effective way to scale an AI team to support software development tasks. However, monitoring the performance and cost of the system is crucial to ensure it continues to meet your needs.
