# rAgents/rVisions/ragents-ollama-integration.md

## Purpose & Overview

This file outlines the integration strategy for using the Ollama AI platform within the rAgents ecosystem of the rEngine Core platform. Ollama is an "Intelligent Development Wrapper" that provides a variety of AI-powered capabilities to enhance the functionality and efficiency of the rAgents system.

The primary goals of this integration are to leverage Ollama's specialized models for tasks like code documentation generation, memory system querying, task routing, code quality analysis, and automated testing. By utilizing local Ollama processing, the rAgents system can achieve improved privacy, speed, cost-efficiency, and overall performance compared to relying solely on cloud-based AI services.

## Key Functions/Classes

1. **Ollama Client**: A unified interface for interacting with the Ollama platform, providing a consistent API for the various task-specific processors.
2. **Ollama Task Processors**:
   - `ollama-doc-generator.js`: Generates function documentation using the `qwen2.5-coder:3b` model.
   - `ollama-memory-query.js`: Processes natural language queries against the rAgents memory system using the `llama3:8b` model.
   - `ollama-task-router.js`: Intelligently routes tasks to appropriate agents based on complexity and domain expertise using the `gemma2:2b` model.
   - `ollama-code-review.js`: Analyzes code quality and provides improvement suggestions using the `qwen2.5-coder:3b` model.
   - Additional processors for automated testing, changelog generation, and other AI-powered enhancements.

## Dependencies

- **Ollama AI Platform**: The rAgents system depends on the Ollama platform for hosting the specialized AI models and providing the necessary APIs for integration.
- **rEngine Core**: This integration is specific to the rEngine Core platform and the rAgents ecosystem.

## Usage Examples

Once the Ollama integration is set up, the rAgents system can leverage the various Ollama-powered capabilities through the following commands:

```bash

# Auto-document entire codebase

npm run ollama:docs:generate

# Natural language memory search

npm run ollama:memory "find table performance issues"

# Intelligent task routing

npm run ollama:route "fix hover bug in inventory table"

# Code quality analysis

npm run ollama:analyze js/inventory.js

# Batch process all files

npm run ollama:batch:analyze
```

## Configuration

The Ollama integration requires the following configuration:

1. **Ollama Installation**: The Ollama platform must be installed on the target machine, and the recommended models must be pulled using the provided commands.
2. **Ollama Client Configuration**: The `rEngine/ollama-client.js` file must be set up with the appropriate Ollama host and authentication details.
3. **Environment Variables**: Any necessary environment variables, such as API keys or other credentials, must be properly configured.

## Integration Points

The Ollama integration is a key component of the rAgents ecosystem within the rEngine Core platform. It seamlessly integrates with the following rEngine Core components:

1. **rAgents Task Execution**: The Ollama-powered task processors are used to enhance the functionality and efficiency of the rAgents task execution system.
2. **rVisions Memory Management**: The Ollama-powered memory querying capabilities improve the rVisions memory system's natural language understanding and retrieval.
3. **rFlow Workflow Orchestration**: The Ollama-powered task routing mechanism can be leveraged by the rFlow workflow orchestration system to optimize task assignment and distribution.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Ollama Unavailability**: If the Ollama platform is unavailable or experiencing issues, the rAgents system should have a fallback to cloud-based AI services to ensure continued functionality.
2. **Model Compatibility**: Ensure that the selected Ollama models are compatible with the rAgents system and that the necessary hardware resources are available to run them efficiently.
3. **Performance Issues**: Monitor the performance of the Ollama-powered tasks and adjust the model selection or hardware configuration as needed to maintain optimal performance.
