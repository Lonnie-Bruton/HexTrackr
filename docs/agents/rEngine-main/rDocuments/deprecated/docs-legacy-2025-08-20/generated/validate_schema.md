# `validate_schema.py` - Memory Vault Schema Validator

## Purpose & Overview

The `validate_schema.py` script is a part of the rEngine Core ecosystem and is responsible for validating memory snapshots and event logs against their respective JSON schemas. This tool ensures the integrity and correctness of the data stored in the Memory Vault, which is a critical component of the rEngine Core platform.

## Key Functions/Classes

The main functions in this script are:

1. **`load_schema(schema_name: str)`**: Loads a JSON schema by name from the `schemas` directory.
2. **`validate_file(file_path: str, schema_name: str, strict: bool = False)`**: Validates a JSON file against a specified schema, reporting any errors or warnings.
3. **`main()`**: The entry point of the script, which handles command-line arguments and calls the `validate_file()` function.

## Dependencies

The `validate_schema.py` script depends on the following libraries:

- `json`: For parsing and handling JSON data.
- `sys`: For interacting with the command-line arguments.
- `pathlib.Path`: For working with file paths.
- `jsonschema`: For validating JSON data against schemas.

## Usage Examples

To use the `validate_schema.py` script, run it from the command line with the following arguments:

```
python validate_schema.py <file_path> <schema_name> [strict]
```

Where:

- `<file_path>` is the path to the JSON file you want to validate.
- `<schema_name>` is the name of the schema to use for validation (e.g., "memory-snapshot", "event-log", "lease").
- `[strict]` is an optional argument that, if set to `true`, will fail the validation if any warnings are found (in addition to errors).

Example usage:

```
python validate_schema.py /path/to/memory-snapshot.json memory-snapshot
```

This will validate the `memory-snapshot.json` file against the "memory-snapshot" schema.

## Configuration

The `validate_schema.py` script does not require any specific environment variables or configuration. It assumes that the JSON schemas are located in the `schemas` directory relative to the script's location.

## Integration Points

The `validate_schema.py` script is designed to be used as a standalone tool within the rEngine Core ecosystem. It can be called by other components or scripts that need to validate JSON data against predefined schemas.

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues and solutions related to the `validate_schema.py` script:

1. **File not found**: Ensure that the specified file path is correct and that the file exists.
2. **JSON decode error**: Verify that the input JSON file is properly formatted and does not contain any syntax errors.
3. **Validation errors**: Review the error messages reported by the script and ensure that the JSON data matches the expected schema.
4. **Missing schemas**: Ensure that the required JSON schemas are present in the `schemas` directory.

If you encounter any other issues, you can try the following steps:

1. Check the script's output for any error messages or clues that might help identify the problem.
2. Verify that the dependencies (Python version, libraries) are up-to-date and compatible with the script.
3. Consult the rEngine Core documentation or reach out to the development team for further assistance.
