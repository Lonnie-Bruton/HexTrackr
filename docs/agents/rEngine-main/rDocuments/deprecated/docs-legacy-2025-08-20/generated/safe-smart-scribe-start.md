# `safe-smart-scribe-start.sh` - Smart Scribe Startup Script

## Purpose & Overview

The `safe-smart-scribe-start.sh` script is a crucial component in the rEngine Core ecosystem, responsible for safely starting and managing the "Smart Scribe" process. The Smart Scribe is a key component of the rEngine Core's "Intelligent Development Wrapper" platform, which provides advanced code analysis and summarization capabilities.

This script ensures that the Smart Scribe is running in a controlled and reliable manner, preventing multiple instances and memory conflicts. It also includes monitoring and management features to ensure the smooth operation of the Smart Scribe within the rEngine Core platform.

## Key Functions/Classes

1. **Ollama Instance Management**: The script ensures that only a single instance of the Ollama model directory is used, preventing conflicts and resource issues.
2. **Process Monitoring**: The script checks for existing Smart Scribe processes, both locally and within Docker containers, and provides options to either continue with the existing process or start a new one.
3. **Memory Usage Monitoring**: The script checks the system's memory usage and warns the user if it is high, providing an option to continue or cancel the startup.
4. **Smart Scribe Startup**: The script starts the Smart Scribe process in the background, saves the process ID for future reference, and provides information about the log file.

## Dependencies

- The script relies on the `ollama-singleton.sh` script, which is used to manage the Ollama instance.
- The script assumes that the Smart Scribe is located in the `rEngine/smart-scribe.js` file, and that the logs are written to the `rEngine/logs/smart-scribe.log` file.

## Usage Examples

To use the `safe-smart-scribe-start.sh` script, simply run it in your terminal:

```bash
./safe-smart-scribe-start.sh
```

The script will handle the startup process, ensuring that the Smart Scribe is running safely and without conflicts.

## Configuration

The script uses the following environment variables:

- `OLLAMA_MODELS`: Specifies the directory where the Ollama models are stored.

## Integration Points

The `safe-smart-scribe-start.sh` script is a critical component in the rEngine Core platform, as it ensures the reliable operation of the Smart Scribe. The Smart Scribe is responsible for providing advanced code analysis and summarization capabilities, which are essential for the rEngine Core's "Intelligent Development Wrapper" functionality.

## Troubleshooting

## Issue: Smart Scribe is already running

- **Cause**: The script detected an existing Smart Scribe process, either locally or within a Docker container.
- **Solution**: The script provides options to either continue with the existing process or kill the existing process and start a new one.

## Issue: High memory usage

- **Cause**: The system's memory usage is high, which could cause issues when running the Smart Scribe.
- **Solution**: The script warns the user about the high memory usage and provides an option to continue or cancel the startup.

## Issue: Ollama singleton manager not found

- **Cause**: The `ollama-singleton.sh` script, which is used to manage the Ollama instance, is not found.
- **Solution**: The script falls back to a basic setup and sets the `OLLAMA_MODELS` environment variable directly.

If you encounter any other issues, please check the logs located at `rEngine/logs/smart-scribe.log` for more information.
