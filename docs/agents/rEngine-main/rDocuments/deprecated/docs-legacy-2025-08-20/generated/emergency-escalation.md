# rPrompts: Emergency Escalation Documentation

## Purpose & Overview

The `emergency-escalation.md` file is part of the `rPrompts` module within the `rLegacy` component of the rEngine Core platform. This file serves as a template for agents to use when they encounter a critical issue that requires immediate human intervention and assistance.

The template provides a structured format for agents to clearly communicate the problem, the steps they have taken, the potential impact, and the specific help they need from a human. This ensures that the escalation process is efficient and the human can quickly understand the situation and provide the necessary support.

## Key Functions/Classes

This file does not contain any code or classes, but rather a template structure for agents to follow when drafting an emergency escalation report. The key elements of the template are:

1. **Escalation Indicator**: The prominent "ESCALATION TO HUMAN REQUIRED" header at the top of the file.
2. **Priority**: The severity level of the issue, ranging from "CRITICAL" to "MEDIUM".
3. **Agent**: The name of the agent attempting to resolve the issue.
4. **Task**: The unique identifier of the task related to the problem.
5. **Issue Summary**: A clear and concise description of the problem.
6. **Blocking Factors**: The specific issues that are preventing the agent from resolving the problem.
7. **Attempted Solutions**: The steps the agent has already taken to try and fix the issue.
8. **Impact Assessment**: An evaluation of how the problem is affecting users, the delivery timeline, and the overall risk level.
9. **Recommendation**: The agent's suggestion for how the human should proceed to resolve the issue.
10. **Additional Context**: Relevant files, error messages, and related tasks that may provide more information.
11. **Human Action Required**: The specific assistance the agent needs from the human to address the problem.

## Dependencies

The `emergency-escalation.md` file is part of the `rPrompts` module, which is a component of the `rLegacy` suite within the rEngine Core platform. It does not have any direct dependencies, but it is intended to be used in conjunction with the `tasks.json` file, which contains the unique identifiers for the various tasks handled by the agents.

## Usage Examples

When an agent encounters a critical issue that they are unable to resolve on their own, they should follow these steps:

1. Copy the contents of the `emergency-escalation.md` file.
2. Fill in the template with the relevant information, such as the priority, agent name, task ID, issue summary, blocking factors, attempted solutions, impact assessment, recommendation, and any additional context.
3. Clearly specify the type of human action required to address the problem.
4. Save the file and escalate the issue to the appropriate human support team.

## Configuration

The `emergency-escalation.md` file does not require any specific configuration. It is a template that agents can use as-is to draft their escalation reports.

## Integration Points

The `emergency-escalation.md` file is part of the `rPrompts` module, which is a component of the `rLegacy` suite within the rEngine Core platform. It is intended to be used by agents when they encounter critical issues that they cannot resolve on their own, and it serves as a communication tool to escalate the problem to human support.

## Troubleshooting

Since the `emergency-escalation.md` file is a template and not a functional component, there are no specific troubleshooting steps required. However, if agents encounter issues with the template or the escalation process, they should reach out to the rEngine Core support team for assistance.
