# MCP Memory Log Viewer

## Purpose & Overview

The `view_mcp_memory_log.sh` script is a part of the rEngine Core ecosystem, specifically designed to provide a real-time monitoring solution for the Memory Control Processor (MCP) operations. This script opens a dedicated console in the Terminal.app application, allowing developers to observe the memory usage and performance of the MCP in real-time.

By following the instructions outlined in the `COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` file, users can launch this script to monitor the MCP's memory usage, which is crucial for optimizing the performance and stability of the rEngine Core platform.

## Key Functions/Classes

The main components and their roles in the `view_mcp_memory_log.sh` script are:

1. **Color Variables**: The script defines several color variables (e.g., `PINK`, `GREEN`, `BLUE`, `CYAN`, `YELLOW`, `RESET`) to enhance the readability and visual appeal of the console output.

1. **Project Directory Retrieval**: The script determines the project directory by navigating to the directory containing the script file.

1. **Terminal.app Console Activation**: The script uses the `osascript` command to interact with the Terminal.app application. It creates a new window, positions it on the right side of the screen, and sets the window title to "MCP Memory Log Monitor".

1. **MCP Memory Log Monitoring**: The script launches a `tail -f` command to continuously monitor the `mcp-memory.log` file located in the `rMemory/logs/` directory. If the log file does not exist, the script creates a new one.

## Dependencies

The `view_mcp_memory_log.sh` script has the following dependencies:

1. **Terminal.app**: The script requires the Terminal.app application to be installed and accessible on the user's system.
2. **COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS.md**: The script follows the instructions outlined in the `COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` file, which likely contains additional information or requirements for the rEngine Core platform.

## Usage Examples

To use the `view_mcp_memory_log.sh` script, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have the rEngine Core platform installed and configured on your system.
2. Navigate to the `scripts/` directory within the rEngine Core project.
3. Run the script using the following command:

   ```bash
   ./view_mcp_memory_log.sh
   ```

   This will open a new Terminal.app window and start monitoring the MCP memory usage in real-time.

## Configuration

The `view_mcp_memory_log.sh` script does not require any specific configuration. However, it relies on the presence of the `rMemory/logs/mcp-memory.log` file, which is likely generated by other components of the rEngine Core platform.

## Integration Points

The `view_mcp_memory_log.sh` script is closely integrated with the rEngine Core platform, specifically the Memory Control Processor (MCP) component. By monitoring the MCP's memory usage, developers can gain valuable insights into the performance and stability of the rEngine Core platform.

This script can be used in conjunction with other rEngine Core tools, such as the "Split Scribe" console, to provide a comprehensive monitoring and debugging solution for the platform.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while using the `view_mcp_memory_log.sh` script, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

1. **Ensure Terminal.app is Accessible**: Verify that the Terminal.app application is installed and can be launched on your system.
2. **Check for the MCP Memory Log File**: Ensure that the `rMemory/logs/mcp-memory.log` file exists in the project directory. If the file is not present, the script will attempt to create a new one.
3. **Verify Project Directory**: Ensure that the script is being executed from the correct project directory. The script relies on the project directory to locate the necessary files and directories.
4. **Review COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS.md**: Refer to the `COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` file for any additional requirements or setup steps that may be necessary for the rEngine Core platform.
5. **Check for Terminal.app Permissions**: Ensure that the Terminal.app application has the necessary permissions to create a new window and execute the monitoring command.

If you continue to experience issues, please consult the rEngine Core documentation or reach out to the support team for further assistance.
