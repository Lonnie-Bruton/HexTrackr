## Memory System Monitor Script

### Purpose & Overview

The `memory-system-monitor.sh` script is a crucial component in the rEngine Core ecosystem, responsible for monitoring and reporting on the memory usage of the rEngine Core platform. This script provides valuable insights into the memory consumption of the system, enabling developers and operators to proactively manage and optimize resource utilization.

### Key Functions/Classes

1. **Memory Monitoring**: The script continuously monitors the memory usage of the rEngine Core system, collecting key metrics such as total memory, available memory, and memory utilization.
2. **Reporting**: The script generates detailed reports on the memory usage, including historical trends and real-time snapshots. These reports can be used to identify memory-related issues and optimize resource allocation.
3. **Alerting**: The script can be configured to trigger alerts when memory usage exceeds predefined thresholds, enabling quick intervention and problem resolution.

### Dependencies

The `memory-system-monitor.sh` script relies on the following dependencies:

1. **Bash**: The script is written in Bash, a widely-used shell and scripting language, and requires a Bash-compatible environment to execute.
2. **System Utilities**: The script utilizes standard system utilities, such as `free`, `awk`, and `date`, to gather and process memory-related information.

### Usage Examples

To use the `memory-system-monitor.sh` script, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the script is located in the `scripts` directory of your rEngine Core installation.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the rEngine Core root directory.
3. Run the script using the following command:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/memory-system-monitor.sh
   ```

   This will initiate the memory monitoring process and display the current memory usage statistics.

1. To schedule the script to run periodically, you can integrate it into your system's cron or task scheduling mechanism.

### Configuration

The `memory-system-monitor.sh` script can be customized using the following environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MEMORY_THRESHOLD` | The memory usage threshold (as a percentage) that triggers an alert. | 80 |
| `REPORT_INTERVAL` | The interval (in seconds) at which the memory usage report is generated. | 60 |
| `LOG_FILE` | The path and filename for the memory usage log file. | `/var/log/rengine/memory-usage.log` |

To set these variables, you can export them in your shell environment or create a configuration file and source it before running the script.

### Integration Points

The `memory-system-monitor.sh` script is closely integrated with the core components of the rEngine Core platform. It provides valuable information to the following components:

1. **Resource Management**: The memory usage data collected by this script is used by the rEngine Core resource management system to optimize resource allocation and ensure efficient utilization of system resources.
2. **Monitoring and Alerting**: The memory usage reports and alerts generated by this script are fed into the rEngine Core monitoring and alerting system, allowing operators to proactively address memory-related issues.
3. **Logging and Auditing**: The memory usage logs produced by this script are stored and maintained as part of the rEngine Core logging and auditing infrastructure.

### Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues and solutions related to the `memory-system-monitor.sh` script:

1. **Script Execution Failure**:
   - Ensure that the script has the necessary permissions to execute (`chmod +x scripts/memory-system-monitor.sh`).
   - Verify that the required dependencies (Bash, system utilities) are installed and available in the system.

1. **Inaccurate Memory Usage Reporting**:
   - Check the values of the configuration variables (`MEMORY_THRESHOLD`, `REPORT_INTERVAL`, `LOG_FILE`) to ensure they are set correctly.
   - Validate that the system utilities used by the script (`free`, `awk`, `date`) are functioning as expected.

1. **Missed Alerts or Unreported Memory Issues**:
   - Verify that the script is properly integrated with the rEngine Core monitoring and alerting system.
   - Ensure that the `MEMORY_THRESHOLD` variable is set to an appropriate value based on your system's requirements.
   - Check the memory usage log file (`LOG_FILE`) for any relevant error messages or unusual patterns.

If you encounter any other issues or require further assistance, please consult the rEngine Core documentation or reach out to the support team.
