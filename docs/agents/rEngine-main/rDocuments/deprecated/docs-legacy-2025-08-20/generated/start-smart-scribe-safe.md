# `start-smart-scribe-safe.sh` - Smart Scribe Startup Script

## Purpose & Overview

The `start-smart-scribe-safe.sh` script is a critical component in the rEngine Core ecosystem. It is responsible for safely starting the Smart Scribe process, which is a key part of the "Intelligent Development Wrapper" platform. This script ensures that the Smart Scribe is running with proper monitoring and safeguards, helping to maintain the stability and performance of the rEngine Core system.

## Key Functions/Classes

1. **Memory Usage Monitoring**: The script checks the current memory usage of the system and compares it to a configurable threshold. This helps prevent the Smart Scribe from being started when the system is already under high memory pressure, which could lead to performance issues.

1. **Existing Process Handling**: The script checks if there are any existing Smart Scribe processes running and provides an option to stop them before starting a new instance.

1. **Smart Scribe Startup**: The script starts the Smart Scribe process by executing the `smart-scribe.js` file in the rEngine directory.

1. **Output Handling**: The script provides colored output to make the startup process more readable and informative for users.

## Dependencies

- The script relies on the `smart-scribe.js` file located in the `../rEngine/` directory relative to the script's location.
- It uses several macOS-specific commands to gather memory usage information, such as `memory_pressure` and `vm_stat`.

## Usage Examples

To start the Smart Scribe in a safe manner, simply run the `start-smart-scribe-safe.sh` script:

```bash
./start-smart-scribe-safe.sh
```

The script will perform the necessary checks and start the Smart Scribe process if the system conditions are acceptable.

## Configuration

The script has the following configurable parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MEMORY_THRESHOLD` | The maximum memory usage percentage before the script will prompt the user to confirm starting the Smart Scribe. | 80% |

These parameters can be adjusted in the script's configuration section.

## Integration Points

The `start-smart-scribe-safe.sh` script is a critical component in the rEngine Core ecosystem. It integrates with the following systems:

1. **Smart Scribe**: The script is responsible for starting and managing the Smart Scribe process, which is a core component of the rEngine platform.
2. **Memory Monitoring**: The script monitors the system's memory usage to ensure that the Smart Scribe can be started without causing performance issues.
3. **Process Management**: The script handles the starting and stopping of the Smart Scribe process, ensuring that only one instance is running at a time.

## Troubleshooting

### Memory Usage Errors

If the script detects that the system's memory usage is above the configured threshold, it will prompt the user to confirm starting the Smart Scribe. If the user decides not to proceed, the script will exit with an error message.

To resolve this issue, you can:

1. Close some running applications to free up memory.
2. Restart the system to release memory resources.
3. Increase the `MEMORY_THRESHOLD` value in the script if the default is too conservative for your system.

### Smart Scribe File Not Found

If the script is unable to locate the `smart-scribe.js` file, it will exit with an error message. Ensure that the file is located in the correct directory relative to the script's location.

### Existing Smart Scribe Process

If the script detects an existing Smart Scribe process, it will prompt the user to stop the existing process and start a new one. If the user chooses to keep the existing process, the script will exit.

To resolve this issue, you can:

1. Stop the existing Smart Scribe process manually.
2. Allow the script to stop the existing process and start a new one.
