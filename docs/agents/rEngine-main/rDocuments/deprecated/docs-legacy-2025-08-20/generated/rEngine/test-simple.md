# Multi-Provider AI System Test Script

## Purpose & Overview

This script is a quick test harness for a multi-provider AI system, which integrates various AI APIs to provide a robust and versatile language model solution. The script tests the integration of two specific AI providers - Groq (Tier 1) and Gemini (Tier 4) - by sending sample prompts and verifying the responses.

The purpose of this script is to ensure that the multi-provider system is functioning correctly and that the individual providers are responding as expected. This allows developers to quickly validate the system's health and identify any issues that may need to be addressed.

## Technical Architecture

The script's architecture consists of the following key components:

1. **Test Functions**: The script defines two asynchronous functions, `testGroq()` and `testGemini()`, which interact with the respective AI providers' APIs to send a sample prompt and retrieve the response.
2. **API Calls**: The test functions use the `fetch()` API to make HTTP requests to the Groq and Gemini API endpoints, passing the necessary authentication credentials and request payloads.
3. **Response Handling**: The test functions parse the API responses and extract the relevant information (e.g., the generated text) to be returned.
4. **Error Handling**: The script wraps the test function calls in a `try-catch` block to handle any errors that may occur during the API requests or response processing.
5. **Main Test Runner**: The `runTests()` function orchestrates the execution of the individual provider tests and logs the results to the console.

The overall data flow is as follows:

1. The `runTests()` function is called, which initiates the testing process.
2. The `testGroq()` function is executed, sending a request to the Groq API and returning the response.
3. The `testGemini()` function is executed, sending a request to the Gemini API and returning the response.
4. The test results for both providers are logged to the console.

## Dependencies

The script has the following external dependencies:

1. **Node.js**: The script is written to be executed in a Node.js environment, as indicated by the shebang line `#!/usr/bin/env node`.
2. **Environment Variables**: The script relies on two environment variables, `GROQ_API_KEY` and `GEMINI_API_KEY`, to provide the necessary authentication credentials for the respective AI providers.

## Key Functions/Classes

1. **`testGroq()`**:
   - Purpose: Sends a test prompt to the Groq API and returns the generated response.
   - Parameters: None.
   - Return Value: The generated response from the Groq API.

1. **`testGemini()`**:
   - Purpose: Sends a test prompt to the Gemini API and returns the generated response.
   - Parameters: None.
   - Return Value: The generated response from the Gemini API.

1. **`runTests()`**:
   - Purpose: Orchestrates the execution of the individual provider tests and logs the results.
   - Parameters: None.
   - Return Value: None.

## Usage Examples

To run the multi-provider AI system test script, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your system.
2. Set the necessary environment variables (`GROQ_API_KEY` and `GEMINI_API_KEY`) with the appropriate API keys for the Groq and Gemini providers.
3. Save the provided code in a file, e.g., `test-simple.js`.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the `test-simple.js` file, and run the following command:

   ```
   node test-simple.js
   ```

   This will execute the `runTests()` function, which will in turn call the individual provider test functions and log the results to the console.

Example output:

```
ðŸ§ª Testing Multi-Provider AI System...

ðŸš€ Testing Groq (Tier 1)...
âœ… GROQ: GROQ AI RESPONDING. One cool fact is that the Groq AI system can generate responses in over 100 languages.

ðŸŒŸ Testing Gemini (Tier 4)...
âœ… GEMINI: GEMINI AI RESPONDING. One cool fact is that the Gemini AI system can generate highly creative and imaginative content.

ðŸŽ‰ Multi-Provider System Working!
```

## Configuration

The script relies on two environment variables for configuration:

1. `GROQ_API_KEY`: The API key required to authenticate with the Groq API.
2. `GEMINI_API_KEY`: The API key required to authenticate with the Gemini API.

These environment variables must be set before running the script. Alternatively, you can hardcode the API keys directly in the script, but this is not recommended for production use, as it would expose the sensitive credentials.

## Error Handling

The script uses a `try-catch` block to handle any errors that may occur during the API requests or response processing. If an error is encountered, the script will log the error message to the console.

Potential errors that may occur include:

- **API Authentication Errors**: If the provided API keys are invalid or expired, the API requests will fail, and the script will log the error message.
- **API Response Errors**: If the API responses are in an unexpected format, the script will throw an error and log the details.
- **Network Errors**: If there are any issues with the network connectivity or the API endpoints, the script will catch the corresponding errors and log them.

## Integration

This multi-provider AI system test script is designed to be a standalone tool for validating the integration of various AI providers into a larger system. It can be used as part of a broader testing suite or as a standalone script to ensure the proper functioning of the multi-provider AI system.

The script can be easily integrated into a continuous integration (CI) or continuous deployment (CD) pipeline, allowing for automated testing and verification of the multi-provider AI system's health.

## Development Notes

- The script uses the `fetch()` API to make the HTTP requests to the Groq and Gemini APIs, which is a modern, built-in JavaScript function for making network requests. This eliminates the need for additional dependencies, such as the `axios` library.
- The script uses `async/await` syntax to handle the asynchronous nature of the API requests, making the code more readable and easier to understand.
- The script employs a simple error handling strategy, logging any encountered errors to the console. In a production environment, you may want to implement more robust error handling and logging mechanisms, such as integrating with a logging service or sending notifications to the development team.
- The script is designed to be easily extensible, allowing for the addition of more AI provider tests in the future. The `runTests()` function can be updated to include calls to new test functions as needed.
