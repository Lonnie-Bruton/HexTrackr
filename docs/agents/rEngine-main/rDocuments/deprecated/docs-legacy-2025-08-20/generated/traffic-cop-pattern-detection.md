# rEngine Core: Traffic Cop Agent - Pattern Detection & Session Management

## Purpose & Overview

The `traffic-cop-pattern-detection.md` file describes a specialized monitoring agent within the rEngine Core ecosystem. This "Traffic Cop" agent is responsible for proactively detecting and intervening in problematic patterns of behavior exhibited by AI agents during development and production use cases.

The core functionality of the Traffic Cop agent includes:

1. **Pattern Detection Systems**: Identifying issues like code fix loops, hallucination patterns, resource thrashing, and repetitive conversation circles.
2. **Intervention Strategies**: Implementing techniques to gracefully terminate problematic sessions, reset corrupted context, rotate between different language models, and escalate to human intervention when needed.

By acting as an "immune system" for the rEngine Core platform, the Traffic Cop agent helps ensure the healthy and productive operation of the hybrid intelligence network, preventing the AI equivalent of autoimmune disorders.

## Key Functions/Classes

The main components of the Traffic Cop agent are:

1. **`TrafficCopAgent`**: The core monitoring engine that coordinates pattern detection and intervention strategies.
   - `PatternDetector`: Implements the various algorithms for identifying problematic behavioral patterns.
   - `InterventionManager`: Handles the execution of different intervention techniques.
   - `SharedMemory`: Integrates with the platform's shared memory system to store and retrieve pattern and intervention data.

```javascript
// Traffic Cop Core Engine
class TrafficCopAgent {
  constructor() {
    this.patterns = new PatternDetector();
    this.interventions = new InterventionManager();
    this.memory = new SharedMemory();
  }

  async monitorSession(sessionId) {
    const patterns = await this.detectProblems(sessionId);
    if (patterns.length > 0) {
      await this.intervene(sessionId, patterns);
    }
  }

  async detectProblems(sessionId) {
    return [
      await this.detectCodeLoops(sessionId),
      await this.detectHallucinations(sessionId),
      await this.detectResourceWaste(sessionId),
      await this.detectConversationCircles(sessionId)
    ].filter(Boolean);
  }
}
```

## Dependencies

The Traffic Cop agent integrates with and depends on several other components within the rEngine Core platform:

1. **Ollama Models**: The agent may leverage existing Ollama models or dedicated monitoring models for advanced pattern recognition.
2. **Shared Memory**: The agent utilizes the platform's shared memory system to store and retrieve pattern and intervention data.
3. **Dual-LLM Architecture**: The agent monitors both the "scribe" and "documentation" worker agents, coordinating their activities and redistributing work when needed.

## Usage Examples

The Traffic Cop agent can be interacted with via the following command-line interface:

```bash

# Traffic Cop Detection Commands

npm run traffic-cop:monitor     # Start monitoring active sessions
npm run traffic-cop:patterns    # View detected patterns
npm run traffic-cop:intervene   # Manual intervention trigger
npm run traffic-cop:reset       # Clean context reset
```

These commands allow developers and operators to:

1. **Monitor Active Sessions**: Initiate the continuous monitoring of active AI sessions.
2. **View Detected Patterns**: Inspect the problematic patterns that have been identified by the agent.
3. **Trigger Intervention**: Manually intervene in a session if needed, using the agent's strategies.
4. **Reset Session Context**: Forcefully reset the context of a session to a clean state.

## Configuration

The Traffic Cop agent does not require any specific environment variables or configuration files. It leverages the platform's shared memory system and integrates with the existing Ollama models and dual-LLM architecture.

## Integration Points

The Traffic Cop agent is a key component of the rEngine Core platform, integrating with several other subsystems:

1. **Monitoring Infrastructure**: The agent's `monitorSession()` method is responsible for continuously checking active AI sessions for problematic patterns.
2. **Intervention Strategies**: The `InterventionManager` class encapsulates the various techniques the agent can use to resolve detected issues.
3. **Shared Memory**: The agent's `SharedMemory` integration allows it to store and retrieve pattern and intervention data, enabling cross-session learning and optimization.
4. **Dual-LLM Coordination**: The agent monitors the communication and behavior of both the "scribe" and "documentation" worker agents, ensuring smooth collaboration and load balancing.

## Troubleshooting

## Common Issues and Solutions:

1. **False Positive Interventions**: If the agent is triggering unnecessary interventions, review the pattern recognition models and adjust the detection thresholds.
2. **Intervention Failures**: If certain intervention strategies are not resolving issues effectively, analyze the intervention history and explore alternative techniques.
3. **Memory Leaks**: Ensure that the agent's memory usage is being properly managed, especially when dealing with large-scale pattern data and intervention logs.
4. **Coordination Conflicts**: If the agent is interfering with the normal operation of the dual-LLM architecture, review the worker coordination logic and communication protocols.

In general, the Traffic Cop agent is designed to be a robust and self-improving system. By continuously monitoring its own performance and learning from intervention outcomes, the agent should become more accurate and efficient over time.
