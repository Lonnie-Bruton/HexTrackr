# rEngine Core: `test-mcp-connection.js` Documentation

## Purpose & Overview

The `test-mcp-connection.js` file is a part of the rEngine Core ecosystem and is responsible for testing the connection between the rEngine Core platform and the MCP (Memory Connection Protocol) server. This script is executed as part of the Smart Scribe startup process to ensure that the MCP server is responding properly and that the memory synchronization process is working as expected.

## Key Functions/Classes

The main component of this file is the `dualWrite()` function, which is imported from the `dual-memory-writer.js` file. This function is responsible for writing a test message to the MCP server and verifying that the server is responding correctly.

## Dependencies

The `test-mcp-connection.js` file depends on the following component:

- `dual-memory-writer.js`: This file contains the `dualWrite()` function, which is used to test the MCP server connection.

## Usage Examples

To use the `test-mcp-connection.js` file, you can simply execute it as part of your Smart Scribe startup process. Here's an example:

```javascript
// In your Smart Scribe startup script
import './test-mcp-connection.js';
```

This will execute the `test-mcp-connection.js` script and log the results to the console.

## Configuration

The `test-mcp-connection.js` file does not require any specific configuration. It uses the default settings for the MCP server connection.

## Integration Points

The `test-mcp-connection.js` file is closely integrated with the Smart Scribe component of the rEngine Core platform. It is executed as part of the Smart Scribe startup process to ensure that the MCP server is responding properly and that the memory synchronization process is working as expected.

## Troubleshooting

If the `test-mcp-connection.js` script fails to connect to the MCP server, you may encounter the following issues:

### MCP Server is not running

If the MCP server is not running, the `dualWrite()` function will fail with an error message indicating that the server is not responding.

**Solution**: Ensure that the MCP server is running and accessible from the rEngine Core platform.

### Incorrect MCP Server Configuration

If the MCP server is not configured correctly, the `dualWrite()` function may fail to connect to the server.

**Solution**: Verify the MCP server configuration, including the hostname, port, and any other relevant settings.

### Network Issues

If there are network issues between the rEngine Core platform and the MCP server, the `dualWrite()` function may fail to connect.

**Solution**: Check the network connectivity between the rEngine Core platform and the MCP server, and troubleshoot any network-related issues.

By addressing these common issues, you can ensure that the `test-mcp-connection.js` script is able to successfully connect to the MCP server and verify the memory synchronization process.
