# rEngine Core: gemini-restoration-request.js

## Purpose & Overview

The `gemini-restoration-request.js` file is part of the rEngine Core ecosystem, an "Intelligent Development Wrapper" platform. This file is used to analyze a file truncation scenario and provide restoration guidance for the `inventory.js` file within the StackTrackr project.

The main purpose of this file is to:

1. Confirm the truncation of the `inventory.js` file.
2. Estimate the number of missing functions between the current and the working reference files.
3. Recommend a safe restoration strategy to recover the missing functionality.
4. Detect any manual edits that might be lost during the restoration process.
5. Provide specific git commands to safely restore the missing functions.

This analysis and guidance is crucial for the StackTrackr project, as the production site relies on the missing import functionality, and users need it restored immediately.

## Key Functions/Classes

The `gemini-restoration-request.js` file does not contain any actual functions or classes. Instead, it provides a detailed analysis request for the Gemini component of the rEngine Core platform.

The file contains an `analysisData` object that provides the necessary information for the Gemini component to perform the analysis, including:

- `currentFile`: The path to the current, truncated `inventory.js` file.
- `workingReference`: The path to the working reference `inventory.js` file.
- `gitCommit`: The Git commit hash of the working reference file.
- `missingFunctions`: An array of function names that are missing from the current file.

## Dependencies

The `gemini-restoration-request.js` file does not have any direct dependencies. It is a standalone analysis request that is intended to be processed by the Gemini component of the rEngine Core platform.

## Usage Examples

As this file is not a standalone executable, it does not have any direct usage examples. The intended usage is for the Gemini component to consume the analysis request and provide the necessary restoration guidance.

## Configuration

The `gemini-restoration-request.js` file does not require any specific configuration. The analysis data is provided within the file itself.

## Integration Points

The `gemini-restoration-request.js` file is designed to be integrated with the Gemini component of the rEngine Core platform. Gemini is responsible for processing the analysis request and providing the restoration guidance.

## Troubleshooting

As this file is an analysis request and not an executable component, there are no specific troubleshooting steps. However, if the Gemini component is unable to process the request or provide the necessary guidance, it may indicate a larger issue within the rEngine Core platform.

In such cases, users should reach out to the rEngine Core support team for further assistance.
