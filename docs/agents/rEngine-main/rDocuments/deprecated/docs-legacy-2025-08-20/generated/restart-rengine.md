# rEngineMCP Quick Restart Script

## Purpose & Overview

The `restart-rengine.sh` script is a utility used within the rEngine Core ecosystem to quickly stop and restart the rEngineMCP (rEngine Micro Control Plane) process. The rEngineMCP is a critical component of the rEngine Core platform, responsible for handling various management and control functions.

This script provides a simple and efficient way to gracefully stop any existing rEngineMCP processes and start a new instance with optimizations for the Mac Mini environment. It ensures a smooth restart of the rEngineMCP, which is necessary for various development and maintenance tasks within the rEngine Core platform.

## Key Functions/Classes

The main functionality of the `restart-rengine.sh` script is:

1. **Stopping Existing rEngineMCP Processes**: The script first checks for and stops any running rEngineMCP processes using the `pkill` command.
2. **Starting a New rEngineMCP Instance**: After the cleanup, the script starts a new rEngineMCP instance in the background using the `node` command. It also captures the process ID (PID) of the new rEngineMCP process.
3. **Validating Successful Startup**: The script verifies that the new rEngineMCP process is running correctly by checking the process status using the `kill` command.
4. **Providing Next Steps**: The script outputs informative messages, including the location of the log file and instructions for the next steps, such as restarting VS Code and using rEngine tools.

## Dependencies

The `restart-rengine.sh` script depends on the following:

1. **Bash Shell**: The script is written in Bash, the default shell on most Unix-based systems, including macOS.
2. **Node.js**: The rEngineMCP is a Node.js application, so the script requires the `node` command to be available in the system's PATH.
3. **rEngineMCP Files**: The script assumes that the rEngineMCP files are located at `/Volumes/DATA/GitHub/rEngine/rEngineMCP`.

## Usage Examples

To use the `restart-rengine.sh` script, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `restart-rengine.sh` script.
3. Run the script by executing the following command:

   ```bash
   ./restart-rengine.sh
   ```

The script will output the progress and status of the rEngineMCP restart process, including any errors or success messages.

## Configuration

The `restart-rengine.sh` script does not require any specific configuration files or environment variables. However, it does assume the following:

1. The rEngineMCP files are located at `/Volumes/DATA/GitHub/rEngine/rEngineMCP`.
2. The `node` command is available in the system's PATH.

If the rEngineMCP files are located in a different directory or the `node` command is not in the PATH, you'll need to update the script accordingly.

## Integration Points

The `restart-rengine.sh` script is an integral part of the rEngine Core platform. It is designed to work seamlessly with the rEngineMCP, which is a key component of the overall rEngine ecosystem. The script can be used by developers, DevOps engineers, or anyone responsible for maintaining the rEngine Core infrastructure.

## Troubleshooting

If the rEngineMCP fails to start or experiences issues, the script provides the following troubleshooting steps:

1. **Check the rengine.log file**: The script outputs the location of the log file (`/Volumes/DATA/GitHub/rEngine/rEngineMCP/rengine.log`), which can be examined for any error messages or clues about the issue.
2. **Verify the rEngineMCP files**: Ensure that the rEngineMCP files are present and accessible at the expected location (`/Volumes/DATA/GitHub/rEngine/rEngineMCP`).
3. **Check the Node.js installation**: Make sure that the `node` command is available and that the version installed is compatible with the rEngineMCP requirements.
4. **Examine system resources**: If the rEngineMCP is failing to start, check the system's available resources (memory, CPU, disk space) to ensure they meet the requirements.
5. **Contact rEngine Core support**: If the issue persists, reach out to the rEngine Core support team for further assistance and troubleshooting.

By following these troubleshooting steps, you can quickly identify and resolve any issues related to the rEngineMCP restart process.
