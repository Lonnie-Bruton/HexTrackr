# rAgents: Project Audit Report

## Purpose & Overview

The `CONSOLIDATED_AUDIT.md` file is a technical report generated by the `rAgents` component of the rEngine Core platform. It consolidates the findings and assessments of multiple AI agents that have performed a comprehensive audit of a software project, in this case the "StackTrackr" project.

The audit covers various aspects of the project, including architecture, code quality, security, performance, scalability, and more. This report provides a centralized view of the project's strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement, empowering project stakeholders to make informed decisions and drive the project's success.

## Key Functions/Classes

The `CONSOLIDATED_AUDIT.md` file is the primary output of the `rAgents` component, which coordinates the execution of multiple AI agents to assess a software project. The key elements within this file are:

1. **Executive Summary**: A high-level overview of the audit findings and methodology.
2. **Methodology**: A description of the AI models used for the assessment, including their names and versions.
3. **Agent Reports**: The individual assessments and findings from each AI agent, categorized by the agent's name and version.

## Dependencies

The `CONSOLIDATED_AUDIT.md` file is generated by the `rAgents` component, which is part of the rEngine Core platform. It relies on the following dependencies:

1. **AI Models**: The `rAgents` component utilizes various AI models, such as `qwen2.5:3b`, `gemma2:2b`, `qwen2:7b`, `llama3:8b`, `gpt-4o-mini`, `claude-3-5-sonnet`, and `gemini-1.5-flash`, to perform the project assessment.
2. **Project Source Code**: The `rAgents` component requires access to the source code of the project being audited, in this case the "StackTrackr" project.

## Usage Examples

To generate a project audit report using the `rAgents` component, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the rEngine Core platform is properly installed and configured.
2. Provide the `rAgents` component with the necessary information about the project to be audited, such as the repository URL, branch, and audit type.
3. Initiate the project audit process, which will trigger the execution of the various AI agents and the generation of the `CONSOLIDATED_AUDIT.md` file.
4. Retrieve the `CONSOLIDATED_AUDIT.md` file from the output directory to access the consolidated audit report.

Here's an example of how you might call the `rAgents` component to generate a project audit report:

```python
from rengine.agents import rAgents

project_info = {
    "repository": "StackTrackr",
    "branch": "main",
    "audit_type": "Multi-Agent Assessment"
}

audit_report = rAgents.conduct_audit(project_info)
audit_report.save("project-audit-report.md")
```

## Configuration

The `rAgents` component requires the following configuration:

1. **API Keys**: The AI models used for the project assessment may require API keys or credentials to access their services. These must be properly configured in the rEngine Core platform for the `rAgents` component to function correctly.
2. **Environment Variables**: Certain environment variables may need to be set to provide the necessary information for the project audit, such as the project repository, branch, and audit type.

## Integration Points

The `CONSOLIDATED_AUDIT.md` file is a key output of the `rAgents` component within the rEngine Core platform. It can be integrated with other components or systems in the following ways:

1. **Project Management**: The audit report can be shared with project stakeholders, such as developers, managers, and product owners, to inform decision-making and drive project improvements.
2. **Continuous Integration/Deployment**: The `rAgents` component can be integrated into a project's CI/CD pipeline to automatically generate audit reports and detect issues early in the development lifecycle.
3. **Knowledge Management**: The audit report can be stored and indexed in a knowledge management system to provide a centralized repository of project assessments and learnings.

## Troubleshooting

In the provided example, there are several issues that could arise:

1. **API Errors**: The reports from the `anthropic_claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` and `openai_gpt-4o-mini` agents indicate API errors, which could be due to incorrect API keys or credentials, or issues with the third-party AI services.
2. **Missing API Keys**: The report from the `google_gemini-1.5-flash` agent indicates that no API key was configured, which is required for the agent to function properly.
3. **Null Reports**: The reports from the `ollama_gemma2:2b`, `ollama_llama3:8b`, `ollama_qwen2:7b`, and `ollama_qwen2.5:3b` agents are all `null`, which could be due to issues with these AI models or their integration within the `rAgents` component.

To troubleshoot these issues, you should check the following:

1. Ensure that all required API keys and credentials are properly configured in the rEngine Core platform.
2. Verify the availability and connectivity to the third-party AI services used by the `rAgents` component.
3. Review the integration and configuration of the `ollama` AI models within the `rAgents` component.
4. Check the logs and error messages for more detailed information about the issues.

If the problems persist, you may need to reach out to the rEngine Core support team or the developers of the specific AI models for further assistance.
