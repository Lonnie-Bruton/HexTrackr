# rScribe Memory System Documentation

## Purpose & Overview

The `rScribe` module in the rEngine Core platform is responsible for managing the memory system for AI agents. This includes monitoring agent activity, tracking memory usage, and providing diagnostic tools to ensure the reliability and performance of the memory system.

The `benchmark_results/memory_review_20250817_080557/ollama_llama3:8b_review.md` file contains a detailed review and analysis of the memory system's capabilities, highlighting its strengths, weaknesses, and potential areas for improvement.

## Key Functions/Classes

The rScribe memory system consists of the following key components:

1. **Memory Scribe Dashboard**: A real-time console monitoring interface that allows administrators to track AI agent activity and potential issues.
2. **MCP Server Integration**: Provides integration and management of the Memory Control Plane (MCP) server, which handles the coordination and storage of agent memory data.
3. **Console Log Monitoring and AI Agent Activity Tracking**: Logs and monitors agent activity, including memory usage and potential problems.
4. **Automated Health Checks**: Periodically checks the health of the memory system and provides desktop alerts for any issues.
5. **Port Management and Conflict Resolution**: Manages the open ports used for communication between agents and the memory system, resolving any conflicts.
6. **Shared Memory Files vs. Personal Agent Memory Files**: Organizes memory data into shared and individual agent-specific files for better management.
7. **API Endpoints**: Exposes API endpoints for external access and integration with the memory system.
8. **File Monitoring, Console Interception, and Activity Logging**: Comprehensive monitoring and logging features to track the overall health and activity of the memory system.

## Dependencies

The rScribe memory system depends on the following components within the rEngine Core platform:

- **Memory Control Plane (MCP) Server**: Handles the coordination and storage of agent memory data.
- **rEngine Core API**: Provides the necessary interfaces and integration points for the memory system to interact with the core platform.
- **Logging and Monitoring Infrastructure**: Ensures that the memory system's activity and health are properly logged and monitored.

## Usage Examples

To utilize the rScribe memory system, AI agents can interact with the provided API endpoints to store, retrieve, and manage their memory data. Here's an example of how an agent might interact with the memory system:

```python
from rengine.api import MemoryAPI

# Initialize the memory API

memory_api = MemoryAPI()

# Store some data in the agent's personal memory

memory_api.store_data("my_key", "my_value")

# Retrieve data from the agent's personal memory

data = memory_api.get_data("my_key")
print(data)  # Output: "my_value"
```

## Configuration

The rScribe memory system relies on the following environment variables and configuration settings:

| Setting | Description | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MEMORY_SERVER_HOST` | The hostname or IP address of the MCP server | `"localhost"` |
| `MEMORY_SERVER_PORT` | The port number of the MCP server | `8080` |
| `MEMORY_LOG_LEVEL` | The logging level for the memory system | `"INFO"` |
| `MEMORY_HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL` | The interval (in minutes) for the automated health checks | `15` |

These settings can be configured in the rEngine Core platform's configuration files or passed as environment variables when running the system.

## Integration Points

The rScribe memory system integrates with the following rEngine Core components:

1. **rEngine Core API**: Provides the necessary interfaces for AI agents to interact with the memory system.
2. **Logging and Monitoring Infrastructure**: Sends logs and health data to the platform's centralized logging and monitoring systems.
3. **MCP Server**: Handles the storage and coordination of agent memory data.

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues and solutions related to the rScribe memory system:

### Slow Performance or High Memory Usage

- **Cause**: The memory system is not properly scaled to handle the current agent load or data volume.
- **Solution**: Review the Memory Scribe dashboard for signs of resource constraints, and scale the MCP server or memory storage accordingly. Consider implementing a more efficient data storage and retrieval mechanism.

### Frequent Health Check Alerts

- **Cause**: The automated health checks are too aggressive or the memory system is experiencing recurring issues.
- **Solution**: Adjust the `MEMORY_HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL` configuration to a more appropriate value, or investigate the root causes of the recurring issues and address them.

### API Endpoint Errors or Timeouts

- **Cause**: The API endpoints are not properly secured or are overwhelmed by requests.
- **Solution**: Ensure that the API endpoints have proper authentication, rate limiting, and input validation mechanisms in place. Monitor the API usage and scale the underlying infrastructure as needed.

### Data Corruption or Loss

- **Cause**: Issues with the memory data storage or synchronization between agents and the MCP server.
- **Solution**: Implement robust data integrity checks and backup/restore mechanisms. Review the logging and monitoring data for any signs of data-related issues.

If you encounter any other issues or have additional questions, please consult the rEngine Core documentation or reach out to the support team for further assistance.
