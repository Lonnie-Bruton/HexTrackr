# sanitize-name-slash.test.js

## Purpose & Overview

This script is a test case for the `sanitizeImportedItem` function, which is part of the `utils.js` module. The purpose of this test is to ensure that the `sanitizeImportedItem` function preserves the slash character (`/`) in the `name` property of the input object.

## Technical Architecture

The script consists of two main parts:

1. **Importing Dependencies**: The script imports the `assert` module from Node.js and the `sanitizeImportedItem` function from the `utils.js` module.

1. **Test Case**: The script creates an object with various properties, including a `name` property that contains a slash character (`/`). It then calls the `sanitizeImportedItem` function with this object as the argument and asserts that the `name` property of the returned object is unchanged.

## Dependencies

This script has the following dependencies:

- `assert` module from Node.js
- `sanitizeImportedItem` function from the `utils.js` module

## Key Functions/Classes

## `sanitizeImportedItem(item)`

- **Parameters:**
  - `item` (Object): An object representing an imported item, with properties such as `name`, `type`, `metal`, `qty`, `weight`, and `price`.
- **Return Value:**
  - (Object): The input object with the `name` property sanitized.
- **Description:**

  This function takes an object representing an imported item and returns a new object with the `name` property sanitized. The purpose of this function is to ensure that the `name` property does not contain any characters that could cause issues in the application.

## Usage Examples

```javascript
const { sanitizeImportedItem } = require('../js/utils.js');

const item = sanitizeImportedItem({
  name: '1/2 oz Round',
  type: 'Round',
  metal: 'Silver',
  qty: 1,
  weight: 1,
  price: 1,
});

console.log(item.name); // Output: '1/2 oz Round'
```

## Configuration

This script does not require any configuration options or environment variables.

## Error Handling

This script does not handle any errors. It assumes that the `sanitizeImportedItem` function is working correctly and that the input object has the expected structure.

## Integration

This script is a test case for the `sanitizeImportedItem` function, which is part of the `utils.js` module. The `utils.js` module is likely used by other parts of the application to perform various utility functions, including sanitizing imported data.

## Development Notes

The main purpose of this script is to ensure that the `sanitizeImportedItem` function preserves the slash character (`/`) in the `name` property of the input object. This is an important feature, as the slash character may be a valid character in product names or other data that is imported into the application.
