# Fuzzy Search Test Suite

## Purpose & Overview

This script, `fuzzy-search.test.js`, is a set of unit tests that verify the functionality of the `fuzzySearch` function, which is part of the `fuzzy-search.js` module. The purpose of this script is to ensure that the `fuzzySearch` function correctly identifies and returns relevant search results based on a provided query string and a list of target strings.

## Technical Architecture

The `fuzzy-search.test.js` script is structured as follows:

1. It imports the `assert` module from Node.js to perform assertions.
2. It imports the `fuzzySearch` function from the `fuzzy-search.js` module.
3. It defines an array of target strings, `targets`, which represents the items to be searched.
4. It calls the `fuzzySearch` function with the query string `'Silver Eagle'` and the `targets` array, and stores the resulting array of search results in the `results` variable.
5. It extracts the `text` property from each search result in the `results` array and stores them in the `texts` array.
6. It performs two assertions:
   - Checks that the `'American Gold Eagle'` string is not included in the `texts` array, as it should not be a match for the `'Silver Eagle'` query.
   - Checks that the `'American Silver Eagle'` string is included in the `texts` array, as it should be a match for the `'Silver Eagle'` query.
1. It logs a success message to the console.

## Dependencies

This script has the following dependencies:

1. `assert`: A built-in Node.js module for writing assertions.
2. `fuzzy-search.js`: The module that contains the `fuzzySearch` function being tested.

## Key Functions/Classes

## `fuzzySearch(query, targets)`

- **Description**: Performs a fuzzy search on the provided `targets` array using the `query` string.
- **Parameters**:
  - `query` (string): The search query.
  - `targets` (string[]): The array of strings to search.
- **Return Value**: An array of search result objects, where each object has the following properties:
  - `text`: The target string that matched the query.
  - `score`: The similarity score between the query and the target string.

## Usage Examples

Here's an example of how to use the `fuzzySearch` function:

```javascript
const { fuzzySearch } = require('../js/fuzzy-search.js');

const targets = ['American Gold Eagle', 'American Silver Eagle', 'Canadian Maple Leaf'];
const results = fuzzySearch('Silver Eagle', targets);

console.log(results);
// Output:
// [
//   { text: 'American Silver Eagle', score: 0.8333333333333334 },
//   { text: 'Canadian Maple Leaf', score: 0.16666666666666666 }
// ]
```

## Configuration

This script does not require any specific configuration options or environment variables.

## Error Handling

The `fuzzySearch` function is expected to handle any errors that may occur during the search process. If an error occurs, it should be properly documented and communicated to the caller.

## Integration

This script is part of the testing suite for the `fuzzy-search.js` module, which is likely used in a larger system or application. The `fuzzySearch` function is intended to be used as a utility for performing fuzzy searches on a set of target strings.

## Development Notes

The implementation of the `fuzzySearch` function is not provided in this script, so any important details or gotchas related to its implementation are not covered here. However, the test suite demonstrates how the function is expected to be used and the expected behavior.
