# heygemini.js Documentation

## Purpose & Overview

`heygemini.js` is a command-line script that allows users to interact directly with the Gemini API, a large language model developed by Google. This script enables users to submit a question or prompt to Gemini and receive a generated response. It serves as a simple, accessible interface for developers and users to explore the capabilities of the Gemini model.

## Technical Architecture

The `heygemini.js` script is built using Node.js and the following key components:

1. **Environment Variables**: The script loads environment variables from a `.env` file located in the `rEngine` directory, specifically the `GEMINI_API_KEY` variable, which is required to authenticate with the Gemini API.

1. **Gemini API Integration**: The script uses the `@google/generative-ai` package to interact with the Gemini API. It creates a `GoogleGenerativeAI` instance, retrieves the "gemini-1.5-pro" model, and generates a response based on the user's input question.

1. **Command-Line Interface**: The script accepts the user's question as a command-line argument, and the `askGemini` function is called with this input to fetch the Gemini response.

1. **Error Handling**: The script includes error handling to gracefully handle any issues that may arise during the API call, such as missing API keys or other errors.

## Dependencies

The `heygemini.js` script has the following dependencies:

- `fs`: For file system operations
- `path`: For file path manipulation
- `url`: For URL-related utilities
- `dotenv`: For loading environment variables from a `.env` file
- `@google/generative-ai`: The package that provides the Gemini API integration

## Key Functions/Classes

### `askGemini(question)`

**Purpose**: Sends a user's question to the Gemini API and returns the generated response.

**Parameters**:

- `question` (string): The user's question or prompt to be sent to the Gemini API.

**Return Value**:

- `text` (string): The response generated by the Gemini API.

**Example Usage**:

```javascript
const response = await askGemini('What is the meaning of life?');
console.log(response);
```

## Usage Examples

To use the `heygemini.js` script, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository or copy the `heygemini.js` file to your local machine.
3. Create a `.env` file in the `rEngine` directory and add your Gemini API key as `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
4. Run the script from the command line:

```
node heygemini.js "What is the capital of France?"
```

or

```
./heygemini "What is the capital of France?"
```

The script will send the question to the Gemini API and display the generated response in the console.

## Configuration

The only configuration required for the `heygemini.js` script is the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable. This variable must be set in the `.env` file located in the `rEngine` directory.

## Error Handling

The `heygemini.js` script includes error handling to handle the following scenarios:

1. **Missing API Key**: If the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable is not found, the script will display an error message and exit.
2. **API Call Errors**: If there are any issues during the Gemini API call, the script will catch the error and display an error message.

In both cases, the script will exit with a non-zero status code to indicate an error.

## Integration

The `heygemini.js` script is a standalone utility that can be used independently. It does not directly integrate with any larger system, but it can be used as a building block or a reference implementation for developers who need to interact with the Gemini API.

## Development Notes

1. **Environment Variable Management**: The script uses the `dotenv` package to load environment variables from a `.env` file. This approach keeps sensitive information (like the API key) out of the source code, making it easier to manage and share the script.

1. **Modular Design**: The script separates the API integration logic into the `askGemini` function, making it easier to maintain and extend the functionality in the future.

1. **Error Handling**: The script includes robust error handling, ensuring that any issues during the API call are properly reported to the user.

1. **Command-Line Interface**: The script accepts the user's question as a command-line argument, providing a simple and accessible interface for interacting with the Gemini API.

1. **Dependency Management**: The script uses modern ES module syntax (`import` and `export`) to manage dependencies, which provides a cleaner and more maintainable codebase.

Overall, the `heygemini.js` script is a well-designed, production-ready utility that can serve as a valuable tool for developers working with the Gemini API.
