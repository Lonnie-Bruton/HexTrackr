# rAgents Integration Notes

## Overview

The rAgents framework integration has been moved to a dedicated development environment for focused iteration and testing.

## Current Status

- **Development Phase**: Active research and prototyping
- **Testing Ground**: Using StackTrackr as validation platform  
- **Architecture**: Hybrid cloud/local AI processing concepts

## Integration Points

While rAgents development continues separately, StackTrackr benefits from:

- Enhanced AI-assisted development workflows
- Improved code analysis and suggestion capabilities  
- Streamlined development processes

## Future Integration

As rAgents concepts mature and prove effective, selected components may be integrated back into the main StackTrackr development workflow.
