# Testing MCP Tool Access for AI Agent Queries

**Date:** August 17, 2025  
**Status:** Looking for rEngineMCP MCP tools in VS Code

## Issue Discovery

The rEngineMCP system provides tools like `analyze_with_ai` through VS Code's MCP interface, but I don't see these tools in my current available tool set.

## Available Tools I Can See

- Memory MCP tools (mcp_memory_*)
- GitHub tools (mcp_github_*)
- Standard VS Code tools (read_file, run_in_terminal, etc.)

## Missing Tools I Need

- `analyze_with_ai` - Main AI analysis tool
- `rapid_context_search` - Quick codebase search
- `get_instant_code_target` - Code targeting
- `vscode_system_status` - AI provider status

## Theory

The rEngineMCP server needs to be running AND connected to VS Code for these tools to appear in my available tool list.

## Next Steps

1. Check if rEngineMCP server is actually running properly
2. Verify VS Code MCP configuration includes rEngineMCP
3. Look for these tools in @use statements in VS Code Chat

This explains why I can't directly query Gemini, Qwen, etc. - the MCP bridge isn't available to me currently.
