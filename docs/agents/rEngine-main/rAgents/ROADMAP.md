## Overview

This roadmap specifically tracks the rAgents multi-agent coordination system, including agent handoffs, memory persistence, and cross-provider communication.

## Current Status

- **Version**: 3.04.75+
- **Active Agents**: Claude Opus, Claude Sonnet, Gemini Pro, GPT-4, GPT-4o, GitHub Copilot
- **Handoff System**: Operational with JSON-based continuity
- **Memory Persistence**: MCP + JSON fallback system

---

## üêõ Known Issues

### Active Issues

- [ ] **Agent Memory Synchronization Lag** (Priority: MEDIUM)
  - Sometimes memory updates don't propagate immediately between agents
  - Workaround: Manual memory refresh before handoff

- [ ] **Cross-Provider Context Limits** (Priority: LOW)
  - Different token limits across providers affect handoff context
  - Need intelligent context summarization

### Resolved Issues

- [x] **Handoff Memory Loss** (Resolved: 2025-08-17)
  - Solution: Enhanced JSON backup system with redundant storage

---

## üöÄ Planned Features

### Next Release

- [ ] Enhanced cross-provider context compression
- [ ] Automated memory validation before handoffs
- [ ] Agent performance metrics tracking
- [ ] Improved error recovery mechanisms

### Future Releases

- [ ] Real-time agent collaboration (multiple agents active)
- [ ] Intelligent task routing based on agent strengths
- [ ] Advanced conflict resolution for competing instructions
- [ ] Agent learning and adaptation systems
