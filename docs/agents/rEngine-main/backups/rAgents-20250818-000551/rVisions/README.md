## 🎯 Purpose

These vision documents serve to:

- **Capture innovative ideas** during development sessions
- **Plan complex architectural changes** before implementation  
- **Maintain strategic direction** across development cycles
- **Enable informed decision-making** for feature prioritization
- **Document the evolution** of StackTrackr's capabilities

## 🚀 Implementation Workflow

1. **Vision Creation** - Document new ideas and architectural concepts
2. **Technical Assessment** - Evaluate feasibility and resource requirements
3. **Prototype Development** - Build proof-of-concept implementations
4. **Integration Planning** - Plan migration and deployment strategies
5. **Production Implementation** - Execute vision with full development cycle

## 📊 Vision Status Tracking
