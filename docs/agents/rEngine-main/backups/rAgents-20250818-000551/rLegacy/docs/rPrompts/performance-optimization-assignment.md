âš¡ **PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION ASSIGNMENT**

**Agent**: GPT-4 (optimal for algorithmic improvements)

**Optimization Target**: [WHAT NEEDS TO BE FASTER]
**Current Performance**: [BASELINE MEASUREMENTS]
**Target Improvement**: [SPECIFIC GOALS - e.g., 50% faster, <200ms response]

**Focus Areas**: [SPECIFIC BOTTLENECKS TO ADDRESS]

**Your Task**:

1. Read performance requirements in `agents/tasks.json`
2. Update status to "in_progress"
3. Follow phases: measure â†’ optimize â†’ validate
4. Document improvements and update memory

**Files to Reference**:

- `agents/performance.json` - Performance baselines
- `agents/functions.json` - Function registry for bottlenecks
- `agents/patterns.json` - Optimization patterns

**Success Criteria**:

- Measurable performance improvement achieved
- No functionality regressions
- Comprehensive testing completed
- Performance metrics documented

**Let's make it fast!** ðŸš€
