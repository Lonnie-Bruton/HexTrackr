## üéØ **Best Agent for Each Task**

- **Security Auditing:** Ollama (qwen2.5-coder) - Most specific, detailed code examples
- **Performance Analysis:** Claude Haiku - Balanced architectural view
- **Code Quality:** Claude Haiku - Best maintainability insights  
- **Quick Analysis:** Groq - Fastest response with good coverage
- **Comprehensive Review:** OpenAI - Most thorough documentation

---

## üîß **How to Query Each Agent**

The rEngineMCP system provides these tools through VS Code MCP:

```javascript
// To query specific agent:
analyze_with_ai({
  content: "StackTrackr codebase analysis",
  operation: "security_audit", 
  // Agent selected by priority system or forced routing
})
```

## Agent Selection:

- Automatic fallback: Groq ‚Üí Claude ‚Üí OpenAI ‚Üí Gemini ‚Üí Ollama
- Manual routing: Specify provider in operation parameter
- Parallel analysis: Query multiple agents simultaneously

*This comparison shows that while my initial report was comprehensive, each specialized agent brings unique perspectives and analysis depth to different aspects of the codebase.*
