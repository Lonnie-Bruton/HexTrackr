### API Relay Infrastructure

```javascript
const RENGINE_CONFIG = {
  relay: {
    production: 'https://api.rengine.dev/relay',
    staging: 'https://staging-api.rengine.dev/relay',
    development: 'http://localhost:8080/relay'
  },
  serviceTiers: {
    free: { requestsPerMonth: 1000, marketIntel: false },
    pro: { requestsPerMonth: 10000, marketIntel: true },
    enterprise: { requestsPerMonth: 100000, marketIntel: true }
  }
}
```
