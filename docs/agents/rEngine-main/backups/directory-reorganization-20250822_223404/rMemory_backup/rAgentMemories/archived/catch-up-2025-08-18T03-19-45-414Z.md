  "summary": "The current system state includes ongoing processes, recent file modifications, Git status, running AI models, and technical knowledge database statistics. Recent decisions have involved optimizing the system's performance and memory usage through better error handling practices. Users prefer to keep track of changes in code files and run diagnostics on the Git repository. Important discoveries include issues with API key management and concerns about scalability and logging. Next steps should focus on refining error patterns and optimizing memory management.",
