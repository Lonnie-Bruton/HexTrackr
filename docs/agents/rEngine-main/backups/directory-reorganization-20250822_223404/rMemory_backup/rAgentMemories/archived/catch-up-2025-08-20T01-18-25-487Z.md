# Handoff Log - StackTrackr AI System (2023-10-27)

## 1. Current Project Status and Active Tasks

### Project Overview

StackTrackr is an advanced AI platform designed to handle various types of data, from text analysis to real-time monitoring. The system incorporates multiple models like Qwen2.5-Coder, Google Gemini, and Anthropic Claude for diverse use cases.

### Current Status

- **Audit Reports**: Multiple audit reports have been generated, focusing on issues related to API key management across different platforms.
- **Benchmark Reports**: Benchmark reports are being analyzed to evaluate the performance of various AI models, focusing on security, execution time, and response quality.
- **Memory Reviews**: Ongoing memory reviews for different agent systems (e.g., qwen2.5:3b, llama3:8b) to identify strengths and weaknesses in memory management.

### Active Tasks

1. **Review Audit Reports**:
   - Continue analyzing audit reports generated for Google Gemini and Anthropic Claude.
   - Document identified issues and recommend fixes.

1. **Analyze Benchmark Results**:
   - Perform a detailed analysis of the StackTrackr LLM Benchmark Report to identify key insights and areas for improvement.
   - Update documentation based on findings.

1. **Conduct Memory Reviews**:
   - Review memory systems for different agents (e.g., ollama_gemma2:2b, openai_gpt-4o).
   - Implement recommended improvements based on reviews.

## 2. Recent Decisions and Their Reasoning

### Decision 1: Address API Key Issues in Audit Reports

**Reasoning**: Ensuring all platforms have valid API keys is critical for maintaining authentication and preventing unauthorized access to services.
