## Handoff Details

## Handoff Log

---

### 1. Current Project Status and Active Tasks

The project is focused on enhancing StackTrackr's security, performance, and overall stability by conducting code audits, benchmarking, and system optimizations. Key tasks include:

- **Code Audits**: Conducting comprehensive code reviews to identify vulnerabilities.
- **Benchmarking**: Running memory and performance benchmarks using various models.
- **System Optimizations**: Implementing changes based on benchmark results for improved system health.

### 2. Recent Decisions and Their Reasoning

**Decision:** The Anthropic API key needs to be set to ensure proper authentication and access to the Anthropic API.

**Reasoning:** Setting up the Anthropic API key is crucial to prevent unauthorized access or denied requests, thereby enhancing security.
