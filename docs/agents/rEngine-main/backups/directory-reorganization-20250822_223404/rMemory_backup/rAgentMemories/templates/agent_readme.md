# Agentic OS Project Bootstrap

This project has been initialized with Agentic OS, a sophisticated agent-based development system that provides intelligent assistance throughout your development process.

## Quick Start

1. Initialize the agent system:

   ```bash
   python agents/scripts/bootstrap_agent_system.py "Your Project Name"
   ```

1. Start the memory system:

   ```bash
   python agents/scripts/initialize_memory.py
   ```

1. Begin development with intelligent assistance from your agent team.

## System Components

### 1. Memory System

- Centralized memory management
- Cross-project memory sharing
- Automatic memory synchronization
- Memory validation and backup

### 2. Agent Team

#### GitHub Copilot Agent

- Code generation and completion
- Documentation assistance
- Test generation
- Code review support

#### GPT-4 Agent

- Strategic planning
- Problem solving
- Architecture design
- Technical decision making

#### Context Manager

- Project context tracking
- Knowledge integration
- Memory management
- Cross-agent coordination

```

## Memory Synchronization

The system automatically syncs with core memories from the rAvents repository, ensuring your agents have access to accumulated knowledge and best practices.

### Synced Memory Files

- `agents/memory.json`: Central memory store
- `agents/github_copilot_memories.json`: Development context
- `agents/gpt4o_memories.json`: Strategic reasoning
- `agents/extendedcontext.json`: Extended project context

## Configuration

The agent system can be configured through:

1. `agents/templates/project_bootstrap.yml`
2. `agents/memory.json`
3. Individual agent memory files

## Best Practices

1. Run memory initialization after significant changes
2. Keep agent memories in sync across projects
3. Review and validate memory contents regularly
4. Backup critical memories before major updates

## Troubleshooting

1. Memory Sync Issues
   - Check GitHub credentials
   - Verify network connection
   - Ensure rAvents repository access

1. Agent System Issues
   - Review initialization logs
   - Check memory file integrity
   - Validate system configuration

## Security

- Memory files contain sensitive project information
- Ensure proper access controls
- Regular security audits
- Monitor for unauthorized modifications

## Support

For issues or questions:

1. Check the documentation in `agents/docs/`
2. Review troubleshooting guides
3. Contact system administrators

## Contributing

When contributing to the agent system:

1. Follow memory management protocols
2. Document changes in agent memories
3. Update relevant documentation
4. Test memory synchronization
