/**
 * DIRECT FILE ANALYSIS REQUEST FOR GEMINI
 * 
 * Gemini, please analyze this file truncation scenario and provide restoration guidance:
 * 
 * CURRENT BROKEN FILE (/rProjects/StackTrackr/js/inventory.js):
 * - Only 1473 lines
 * - Ends with: updateSummary function
 * - Missing ALL import functions
 * 
 * WORKING REFERENCE (/tmp/working_inventory.js):
 * - Complete 2416 lines extracted from git commit d9a9285
 * - Contains importCsv, importJson, importNumistaCsv functions
 * - All progress tracking functions present
 * 
 * ANALYSIS QUESTIONS:
 * 
 * 1. TRUNCATION CONFIRMATION:
 *    Can you confirm the current file is truncated at line 1473?
 *    The working reference has 943 more lines - are these the import functions?
 * 
 * 2. MISSING FUNCTION ESTIMATE:
 *    How many functions are missing between line 1473 and 2416?
 *    Are importCsv and importJson the main missing functions?
 * 
 * 3. RESTORATION STRATEGY:
 *    Should we do full file replacement from git commit d9a9285?
 *    Or append missing lines 1474-2416 to current file?
 *    Which approach preserves any recent edits?
 * 
 * 4. MANUAL EDIT DETECTION:
 *    Are there differences in lines 1-1473 between current and reference?
 *    What manual edits might be lost with full replacement?
 * 
 * 5. SAFE RESTORATION APPROACH:
 *    Recommend exact git commands to safely restore missing functions
 *    Should we backup current truncated file first?
 * 
 * CRITICAL CONTEXT:
 * - Production site stackrtrackr.com works correctly with v3.04.87
 * - Users need CSV/JSON import functionality immediately
 * - Current truncated file causes "importCsv is not defined" errors
 * - Events.js calls importCsv(file, csvImportOverride) but function missing
 * 
 * Please provide specific restoration commands and safety recommendations.
