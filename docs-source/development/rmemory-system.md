## Usage Patterns

### Starting a New Session

```bash

# 1. Pin perfect-continuity-boot.prompt.md to chat

# 2. Execute boot protocol:

"Execute Perfect Continuity Boot Protocol"

# Result: Instant project awareness with complete context

```

### Generating Context Briefings

```bash

# Generate comprehensive project briefing

node .rMemory/scribes/agent-context-loader.js

# Output:

# - .rMemory/agent-context/agent-briefing-YYYY-MM-DD.md

# - .rMemory/agent-context/context-data-YYYY-MM-DD.json

```

### Frustration Analysis and Prevention

```bash

# Analyze frustration patterns

node .rMemory/scribes/frustration-matrix.js

# Process chat logs for pain points

node .rMemory/scribes/deep-chat-analysis.js --frustration-focus

# Real-time monitoring

node .rMemory/scribes/real-time-analysis.js --monitor
```

### Project Context Loading

```bash

# Load project-specific context

cat .rMemory/agent-playbooks/agent-playbook-hextrackr.md

# Search memory for current status

# (via Memento MCP in VS Code)

memento.search("project:HexTrackr status:current")
```
