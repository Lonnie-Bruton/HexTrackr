# Vulnerability Management Guide

The Vulnerability Management dashboard (`vulnerabilities.html`) is a powerful tool for analyzing, tracking, and managing security vulnerabilities across your assets.

## Importing Vulnerability Data

The primary way to populate the dashboard is by importing CSV files from vulnerability scanners.

1. From the dashboard, click the **Import** button.
2. You will be prompted to select a **Scan Date**. This date is critical for accurate historical trending. It should be the date the vulnerability scan was performed.
3. After confirming the date, select the CSV file from your computer.

The system will then upload and process the file. Thanks to the [rollover architecture](../architecture/rollover-mechanism.md), the new data will be integrated, and the dashboard will automatically refresh.

## The Dashboard

The dashboard provides multiple ways to analyze your vulnerability data.

### Statistics Cards

At the top of the page, you'll find cards summarizing the current vulnerability state by severity. You can **click on any card** to flip it and view the data in two ways:

- **Vulnerability Counts**: The total number of vulnerabilities for that severity.
- **VPR Totals**: The sum of the Vulnerability Priority Rating (VPR) scores for that severity, giving you a risk-based perspective.

### Historical Trend Chart

The main chart visualizes vulnerability trends over time. You can toggle the view to see trends based on:

- **Vulnerability Count**
- **VPR Score Sum**

This allows you to see whether your overall risk is increasing or decreasing.

## Data Views

You can switch between three different views to analyze the data from different perspectives:

### 1. Table View

This is the default view, powered by AG Grid. It provides a detailed, sortable, and filterable table of all current vulnerabilities.

- **Sorting**: Click on any column header to sort the data.
- **Filtering**: Use the search bar and the severity dropdown to filter the data.

### 2. Devices View

This view groups all vulnerabilities by the affected device (hostname). Each card represents a device and shows:

- The total number of vulnerabilities on that device.
- The total VPR score for that device.
- A breakdown of vulnerabilities by severity.

Click **View Device Details** to see a list of all vulnerabilities affecting that specific device.

### 3. Vulnerabilities View

This view groups all findings by CVE (or plugin ID if a CVE is not available). Each card represents a unique vulnerability and shows:

- The number of devices affected by it.
- The total VPR score it contributes across all devices.
- A breakdown of the severity of the findings.

Click on a card to see a list of all devices affected by that vulnerability.

## CVE Lookup

From the Table or Vulnerability views, you can click on any CVE identifier (e.g., `CVE-2023-12345`) to look it up on the [MITRE CVE website](https://cve.mitre.org/). This provides you with detailed information about the vulnerability from the authoritative source.

## Exporting and Backing Up Data

For detailed instructions on how to export the data from this view or perform a system-wide backup, please see the following guides:

- [Backing Up and Restoring Data](./backup-restore.md)
