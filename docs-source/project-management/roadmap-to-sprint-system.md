# Roadmap-to-Sprint Project Management System

The HexTrackr project uses a structured roadmap-to-sprint system that links high-level planning with actionable sprint execution, backed by Memento MCP persistent memory.

## System Overview

### Core Components

1. **Master Roadmap** (`ROADMAP.md`) - High-level project direction and milestones
2. **Active Sprints** (`roadmaps/sprint-*.md`) - Focused execution documents
3. **Memento Memory** - Persistent context and decision tracking
4. **AGENTS.md Playbook** - 7-step turn loop process for consistent execution

### Integration Flow

```text
ROADMAP.md 
    ‚Üì links to
Active Sprint Document
    ‚Üì tracks with  
Memento Knowledge Graph
    ‚Üì follows
AGENTS.md Process
```

## Sprint Structure

### Three-Round Methodology

Each sprint follows a structured 3-round approach:

- **Round 1**: Critical Issues (Security, Blockers)
- **Round 2**: Code Quality (Standards, Maintainability)
- **Round 3**: Optimization (Performance, Enhancement)

### Sprint Document Template

Active sprints use standardized structure:

```markdown

# Sprint: [Name] - [Date-Time]

## üéØ Sprint Objective

[Clear goal statement]

## üìä Sprint Progress Overview

[Metrics and targets]

## üöÄ Context for Resume

[Current state and next steps]

## üéØ ROUND 1: [Focus Area]

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: [Task]

### ‚è≥ Phase 2: [Next Task]

```

## Memento Integration

### Entity Types

- **roadmap**: Master planning document
- **active_sprint**: Current execution sprint
- **sprint_checklist**: Real-time progress tracking
- **project_management_system**: System metadata
- **quality_gate**: Assessment criteria

### Relationship Tracking

The system maintains relationships between:

- Roadmap ‚Üí Active Sprint (tracking)
- Sprint ‚Üí Checklist (progress monitoring)
- System ‚Üí Quality Gates (compliance)

## Usage Workflow

### 1. Planning Phase

1. Update master `ROADMAP.md` with new objectives
2. Create sprint document in `roadmaps/` directory
3. Link from roadmap to active sprint
4. Initialize Memento entities

### 2. Execution Phase

1. Follow AGENTS.md 7-step process:
   - Observe current state
   - Plan next action
   - Check safeguards
   - Execute task
   - Verify results
   - Update memory mapping
   - Log decisions

1. Update sprint checklist in real-time
2. Maintain Memento context throughout

### 3. Review Phase

1. Complete sprint rounds systematically
2. Document outcomes in ADRs
3. Update roadmap with progress
4. Archive completed sprint

## File Locations

- **Master Roadmap**: `/ROADMAP.md`
- **Sprint Documents**: `/roadmaps/sprint-[name]-[YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM].md`
- **Process Guide**: `/AGENTS.md`
- **Decision Records**: `/docs/adr/`

## Benefits

### Persistent Context

- Memento MCP maintains project memory across sessions
- Decisions and context preserved automatically
- AI agents can resume work effectively

### Structured Progress

- Clear phases and checkpoints
- Measurable targets and outcomes
- Consistent methodology across sprints

### Quality Assurance

- Integration with Codacy analysis
- Automatic compliance checking
- Documentation of all changes

## Current Implementation

### Active Sprint: Security Compliance

- **Document**: `roadmaps/sprint-security-compliance-2025-08-29-1630.md`
- **Focus**: Eliminate 4 critical security vulnerabilities
- **Target**: 83 ‚Üí 30 Codacy issues
- **Methodology**: Security ‚Üí Quality ‚Üí Optimization

### Memento Status

- ‚úÖ Entities created and linked
- ‚úÖ Real-time checklist tracking
- ‚úÖ Sprint-to-roadmap relationships established

## Next Steps

1. Select priority security issue from Codacy dashboard
2. Execute Round 1 security fixes using sprint methodology
3. Document decisions and maintain Memento context
4. Progress through quality and optimization rounds

This system ensures consistent, traceable project management while maintaining the flexibility needed for agile development.
