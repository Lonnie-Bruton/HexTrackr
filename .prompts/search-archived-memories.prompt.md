# Search Archived Project Memories

You are searching through archived project memories that contain historical knowledge about HexTrackr, StackTrackr, and rEngine projects. These are preserved for reference but marked as archived to avoid confusion with current work.

## Search Strategy

Use semantic search with appropriate filters to find relevant archived knowledge:

```
mcp_memento_semantic_search with query: "[your search terms]"
entity_types: ["archived_decision", "archived_knowledge", "archived_issue", "legacy_project"]
```

## Understanding Results

## Entity Types:

- `archived_decision` - Past architectural decisions and reasoning
- `archived_knowledge` - General learnings, insights, and best practices
- `archived_issue` - Old bugs, problems, and their solutions
- `legacy_project` - Historical project context and overview

## Key Tags to Look For:

- `status:archived` - Confirms this is historical data
- `project:HexTrackr-legacy` - Old HexTrackr knowledge
- `project:StackTrackr-legacy` - StackTrackr project memories
- `project:rEngine-legacy` - Memory system experiments
- `migration_date:2025-08-29` - When archived

## Usage Guidelines

✅ **Good for:** Understanding past decisions, learning from previous approaches, finding context for "why was this built this way"

❌ **Avoid:** Treating archived roadmaps as current tasks, assuming archived issues are still active

## Example Queries

- "authentication approach decisions" - Find past auth architecture choices
- "database migration lessons" - Learn from previous migration experiences  
- "UI framework decisions" - Understand frontend technology choices
- "deployment challenges" - Find past deployment issues and solutions

Remember: These are historical references to inform current decisions, not active tasks or current project state.
