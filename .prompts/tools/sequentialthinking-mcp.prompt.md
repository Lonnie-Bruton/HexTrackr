# Sequential Thinking MCP Server

## Overview

The Sequential Thinking MCP server provides advanced reasoning capabilities through structured, multi-step analysis. It enables dynamic problem-solving with the ability to revise, branch, and adapt thinking processes as understanding deepens.

## Key Capabilities

- **Dynamic Reasoning**: Flexible thinking process that can adapt and evolve
- **Thought Revision**: Question or revise previous insights as understanding develops
- **Branching Logic**: Explore alternative approaches and decision paths
- **Hypothesis Generation**: Create and verify solution hypotheses
- **Context Maintenance**: Preserve reasoning context across multiple steps
- **Problem Decomposition**: Break complex problems into manageable components

## HexTrackr Usage Patterns

- **Security Analysis**: Multi-step vulnerability assessment and fix planning
- **Architecture Design**: Complex system design with iterative refinement
- **Debugging Complex Issues**: Systematic problem diagnosis and resolution
- **Release Planning**: Multi-phase project planning with risk assessment
- **Code Refactoring**: Analyze dependencies and plan safe refactoring approaches

## When to Use Sequential Thinking

- Breaking down complex problems into steps
- Planning and design work requiring course correction
- Analysis where full scope might not be clear initially
- Problems requiring multi-step solutions
- Tasks needing context maintenance over multiple steps
- Filtering out irrelevant information from complex scenarios
- Situations requiring hypothesis generation and verification

## Integration with HexTrackr Workflows

- **Security Sprint Planning**: Systematically analyze 65 security vulnerabilities
- **Documentation Review**: Multi-step accuracy verification and link standardization
- **Feature Implementation**: Complex feature development with dependency analysis
- **Bug Investigation**: Systematic debugging with iterative hypothesis testing
- **Performance Optimization**: Multi-step analysis of bottlenecks and solutions

## Best Practices

- Start with initial thought estimate but be ready to adjust
- Express uncertainty and explore alternatives when appropriate
- Use revision capabilities to correct misunderstandings
- Branch reasoning paths for different scenarios
- Maintain focus on relevant information while filtering noise
- Generate clear solution hypotheses for verification
