- `styles.css` - Shared Bootstrap-based styling (522 lines)

## Critical Functionality Preserved
✅ **Drag/drop sort on devices** - Full device management with grip handles  
✅ **Auto incrementing hostnames** - Smart hostname generation (nswan01→nswan02)  
✅ **File bundle exports** - ZIP generation with PDFs, CSVs, docs, attachments  
✅ **Markdown generation** - Formatted output for Hexagon ticket system  
✅ **ServiceNow/Hexagon bridge** - Complete workflow integration  

## How to Use This Backup

1. Copy these files back to the root directory
2. Immediately resume normal workflow operations
3. Continue using the ticket bridge while debugging new version

## Dependencies
