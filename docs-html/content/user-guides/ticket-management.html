</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>From the main ticket list, you can view a ticket&#39;s details or download a bundle of its information.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>View Ticket</strong>: Click the <strong>View</strong> (eye) icon to see a clean, markdown-formatted version of the ticket&#39;s details in a modal.</li>
<li><strong>Download Bundle</strong>: Click the <strong>Download Bundle</strong> (download icon) to get a <code>.zip</code> archive containing:<ul>
<li>The ticket details in <strong>PDF</strong> format.</li>

<li>Any other attached documentation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Searching and Filtering</h2>
<p>The ticket list can be quickly filtered to find what you need.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Global Search</strong>: The main search bar filters tickets based on a wide range of fields, including XT#, Hexagon #, ServiceNow #, location, site, supervisor, tech, and device names.</li>
<li><strong>Status Filter</strong>: Use the dropdown to show tickets with a specific status (e.g., &quot;Open&quot;, &quot;Overdue&quot;).</li>
<li><strong>Location Filter</strong>: This dropdown is dynamically populated with all unique locations from the tickets in the database, allowing you to easily filter by a specific location.</li>
</ul>

<p>HexTrackr provides several options for exporting your ticket data.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quick Exports</strong>: Use the <code>CSV</code>, <code>Excel</code>, <code>JSON</code>, <code>PDF</code>, and <code>HTML</code> buttons at the top of the page to quickly export the currently filtered list of tickets.</li>
