    <h1>Vulnerability Management Guide</h1>
<p>The Vulnerability Management dashboard (<code>vulnerabilities.html</code>) is a powerful tool for analyzing, tracking, and managing security vulnerabilities across your assets.</p>
<h2>Importing Vulnerability Data</h2>
<p>The primary way to populate the dashboard is by importing CSV files from vulnerability scanners.</p>
<ol>
<li>From the dashboard, click the <strong>Import</strong> button.</li>
<li>You will be prompted to select a <strong>Scan Date</strong>. This date is critical for accurate historical trending. It should be the date the vulnerability scan was performed.</li>
<li>After confirming the date, select the CSV file from your computer.</li>
</ol>
<p>The system will then upload and process the file. Thanks to the <a href="../architecture/rollover-mechanism.html">rollover architecture</a>, the new data will be integrated, and the dashboard will automatically refresh.</p>
<h2>The Dashboard</h2>
<p>The dashboard provides multiple ways to analyze your vulnerability data.</p>
<h3>Statistics Cards</h3>
<p>At the top of the page, you&#39;ll find cards summarizing the current vulnerability state by severity. You can <strong>click on any card</strong> to flip it and view the data in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vulnerability Counts</strong>: The total number of vulnerabilities for that severity.</li>
<li><strong>VPR Totals</strong>: The sum of the Vulnerability Priority Rating (VPR) scores for that severity, giving you a risk-based perspective.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Historical Trend Chart</h3>
<p>The main chart visualizes vulnerability trends over time. You can toggle the view to see trends based on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vulnerability Count</strong></li>
<li><strong>VPR Score Sum</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This allows you to see whether your overall risk is increasing or decreasing.</p>
<h2>Data Views</h2>
<p>You can switch between three different views to analyze the data from different perspectives:</p>
<h3>1. Table View</h3>
<p>This is the default view, powered by AG Grid. It provides a detailed, sortable, and filterable table of all current vulnerabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sorting</strong>: Click on any column header to sort the data.</li>
<li><strong>Filtering</strong>: Use the search bar and the severity dropdown to filter the data.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Devices View</h3>
<p>This view groups all vulnerabilities by the affected device (hostname). Each card represents a device and shows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The total number of vulnerabilities on that device.</li>
<li>The total VPR score for that device.</li>
<li>A breakdown of vulnerabilities by severity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Click <strong>View Device Details</strong> to see a list of all vulnerabilities affecting that specific device.</p>
<h3>3. Vulnerabilities View</h3>
<p>This view groups all findings by CVE (or plugin ID if a CVE is not available). Each card represents a unique vulnerability and shows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of devices affected by it.</li>
<li>The total VPR score it contributes across all devices.</li>
<li>A breakdown of the severity of the findings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Click on a card to see a list of all devices affected by that vulnerability.</p>
<h2>CVE Lookup</h2>
<p>From the Table or Vulnerability views, you can click on any CVE identifier (e.g., <code>CVE-2023-12345</code>) to look it up on the <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/">MITRE CVE website</a>. This provides you with detailed information about the vulnerability from the authoritative source.</p>
<h2>Exporting and Backing Up Data</h2>
<p>For detailed instructions on how to export the data from this view or perform a system-wide backup, please see the following guides:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="./backup-restore.html">Backing Up and Restoring Data</a></li>
</ul>
